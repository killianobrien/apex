  "body": "  A Note on Using this Text  Thank you for reading this short preface. Allow us to share a few key points about the text so that you may better understand what you will find beyond this page.  This text comprises a three volume series on Calculus. The first part covers material taught in many Calc 1 courses: limits, derivatives, and the basics of integration, found in Chapters 1 through 6.1. The second text covers material often taught in Calc 2: integration and its applications, including an introduction to differential equations, along with an introduction to sequences, series and Taylor Polynomials, found in Chapters 5 through 8. The third text covers topics common in Calc 3 or multivariable calc: parametric equations, polar coordinates, vector-valued functions, and functions of more than one variable, found in Chapters 10 through 15. All three are available separately for free at apexcalculus.com , and HTML versions of the book can be found at opentext.uleth.ca .  These three texts are intended to work together and make one cohesive text, APEX Calculus , which can also be downloaded from the website.  Printing the entire text as one volume makes for a large, heavy, cumbersome book. One can certainly only print the pages they currently need, but some prefer to have a nice, bound copy of the text. Therefore this text has been split into these three manageable parts, each of which can be purchased for about $15 at Amazon.com .    For Students: How to Read this Text  Mathematics textbooks have a reputation for being hard to read. High level mathematical writing often seeks to say much with few words, and this style often seeps into texts of lower level topics. This book was written with the goal of being easier to read than many other calculus textbooks, without becoming too verbose.  Each chapter and section starts with an introduction of the coming material, hopefully setting the stage for why you should care, and ends with a look ahead to see how the just learned material helps address future problems.    Please read the text  It is written to explain the concepts of Calculus. There are numerous examples to demonstrate the meaning of definitions, the truth of theorems, and the application of mathematical techniques. When you encounter a sentence you don't understand, read it again. If it still doesn't make sense, read on anyway, as sometimes confusing sentences are explained by later sentences.   You don't have to read every equation  The examples generally show all the steps needed to solve a problem. Sometimes reading through each step is helpful; sometimes it is confusing. When the steps are illustrating a new technique, one probably should follow each step closely to learn the new technique. When the steps are showing the mathematics needed to find a number to be used later, one can usually skip ahead and see how that number is being used, instead of getting bogged down in reading how the number was found.   Most proofs have been omitted  In mathematics, proving something is always true is extremely important, and entails much more than testing to see if it works twice. However, students often are confused by the details of a proof, or become concerned that they should have been able to construct this proof on their own. To alleviate this potential problem, we do not include the proofs to most theorems in the text. The interested reader is highly encouraged to find proofs online or from their instructor. In most cases, one is very capable of understanding what a theorem means and how to apply it without knowing fully why it is true.       Interactive, 3D Graphics  Versions 3.0 and 4.0 of the textbook include interactive, 3D graphics in the PDF version. Nearly all graphs of objects in space can be rotated, shifted, and zoomed in\/out so the reader can better understand the object illustrated. However, the only pdf viewers that support these 3D graphics are Adobe Reader Acrobat (and only the versions for PC\/Mac\/Unix\/Linux computers, not tablets or smartphones).  The latest version of the book, which is authored in PreTeXt , is available in HTML . In HTML , the 3D graphics are rendered using WebGL, and should work in any modern web browser.  Interactive graphics are no longer supported within the PDF , but clicking on any 3D graphic within the PDF will take you directly to the interactive version on the web.     Affordable Print and Electronic teXts   is a consortium of authors who collaborate to produce high quality, low cost textbooks. The current textbook writing paradigm is facing a potential revolution as desktop publishing and electronic formats increase in popularity. However, writing a good textbook is no easy task, as the time requirements alone are substantial. It takes countless hours of work to produce text, write examples and exercises, edit and publish. Through collaboration, however, the cost to any individual can be lessened, allowing us to create texts that we freely distribute electronically and sell in printed form for an incredibly low cost. Having said that, nothing is entirely free; someone always bears some cost. This text cost the authors of this book their time, and that was not enough. APEX Calculus would not exist had not the Virginia Military Institute, through a generous Jackson Hope grant, given the lead author significant time away from teaching so he could focus on this text.

First PreTeXt Edition (Version 5.0)  Key changes from Version 4.0 to 5.0:   The underlying source code has been completely rewritten, to use the PreTeXt language, instead of the original .    Using PreTeXt allows us to produce the books in multiple formats, including HTML , which is both more accessible and more interactive than the original PDF . HTML versions of the book can be found at opentext.uleth.ca .    The appendix on differential equations from the Calculus for Quarters version of the book has been included as Chapter 8, just after applications of integration.

  "body": " A Brief History of Calculus   Calculus means a method of calculation or reasoning. When one computes the sales tax on a purchase, one employs a simple calculus. When one finds the area of a polygonal shape by breaking it up into a set of triangles, one is using another calculus. Proving a theorem in geometry employs yet another calculus.  Despite the wonderful advances in mathematics that had taken place into the first half of the 17th century, mathematicians and scientists were keenly aware of what they could not do. (This is true even today.) In particular, two important concepts eluded mastery by the great thinkers of that time: area and rates of change.  Area seems innocuous enough; areas of circles, rectangles, parallelograms, etc., are standard topics of study for students today just as they were then. However, the areas of arbitrary shapes could not be computed, even if the boundary of the shape could be described exactly.  Rates of change were also important. When an object moves at a constant rate of change, then . But what if the rate is not constant can distance still be computed? Or, if distance is known, can we discover the rate of change?  It turns out that these two concepts were related. Two mathematicians, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, are credited with independently formulating a system of computing that solved the above problems and showed how they were connected. Their system of reasoning was a calculus. However, as the power and importance of their discovery took hold, it became known to many as the calculus. Today, we generally shorten this to discuss calculus.   "

  "title": "An Introduction To Limits",
  "body": " An Introduction To Limits   We begin our study of limits by considering examples that demonstrate key concepts that will be explained as we progress.   The concept of a limit    Consider the function . When is near the value 1, what value (if any) is near?  While our question is not precisely formed (what constitutes near the value 1 ?), the answer does not seem difficult to find. One might think first to look at a graph of this function to approximate the appropriate values. Consider Figure , where is graphed. For values of near 1, it seems that takes on values near . In fact, when , then , so it makes sense that when is near 1, will be near  .          near         Consider this same function again at a different value for . When is near , what value (if any) is near? By considering Figure , one can see that it seems that takes on values near . But what happens when ? We have . The expression has no value; it is limit indeterminate form  indeterminate form  indeterminate . Such an expression gives no information about what is going on with the function nearby. We cannot find out how behaves near for this function simply by letting .   near         Finding a limit entails understanding how a function behaves near a particular value of . Before continuing, it will be useful to establish some notation. Let ; that is, let be a function of for some function . The expression the limit of as approaches describes a number, often referred to as , that nears as nears . We write all this as . This is not a complete definition (that will come in the next section); this is a pseudo-definition that will allow us to explore the idea of a limit. limit pseudo-definition   Above, where , we approximated . (We approximated these limits, hence used the symbol, since we are working with the pseudo-definition of a limit, not the actual definition.)   Investigating    Once we have the true definition of a limit, we will find limits analytically ; that is, exactly using a variety of mathematical tools. For now, we will approximate limits both graphically and numerically. Graphing a function can provide a good approximation, though often not very precise. Numerical methods can provide a more accurate approximation. We have already approximated limits graphically, so we now turn our attention to numerical approximations.  Consider again . To approximate this limit numerically, we can create a table of and values where is near  . This is done in Figure .  Notice that for values of near , we have near . The row is included, but we stress the fact that when considering limits, we are not concerned with the value of the function at that particular value; we are only concerned with the values of the function when is near 1.   Values of with near        0.9  0.870363    0.99  0.844471    0.999  0.841772    1  0.841471    1.001  0.841170    1.01  0.838447    1.1  0.810189     Now approximate numerically. We already approximated the value of this limit as graphically in Figure . Figure shows the value of for values of near . Ten places after the decimal point are shown to highlight how close to the value of gets as takes on values very near . We include the row but again stress that we are not concerned with the value of our function at , only on the behavior of the function near  .   Values of with near        -0.1  0.9983341665    -0.01  0.9999833334    -0.001  0.9999998333    0  not defined    0.001  0.9999998333    0.01  0.9999833334    0.1  0.9983341665     This numerical method gives confidence to say that is a good approximation of ; that is, .  Later we will be able to prove that the limit is exactly  .  We now consider several examples that allow us explore different aspects of the limit concept.   Approximating the value of a limit   Use graphical and numerical methods to approximate .    Video solution     To graphically approximate the limit, graph on a small interval that contains . To numerically approximate the limit, create a table of values where the values are near . This is done in Figure and Figure , respectively.    Graphically approximating a limit in Example         Numerically approximating a limit in Example                    3  not defined                  The graph shows that when is near , the value of is very near . By considering values of near , we see that is a better approximation. The graph and the table imply that .    This example may bring up a few questions about approximating limits (and the nature of limits themselves).   If a graph does not produce as good an approximation as a table, why bother with it?    How many values of in a table are enough? In the previous example, could we have just used and found a fine approximation?     Graphs are useful since they give a visual understanding concerning the behavior of a function. Sometimes a function may act erratically near certain values which is hard to discern numerically but very plain graphically (see Example ). Since graphing utilities are very accessible, it makes sense to make proper use of them.  Since tables and graphs are used only to approximate the value of a limit, there is not a firm answer to how many data points are enough. Include enough so that a trend is clear, and use values (when possible) both less than and greater than the value in question. In Example , we used both values less than and greater than . Had we used just , we might have been tempted to conclude that the limit had a value of . While this is not far off, we could do better. Using values on both sides of 3 helps us identify trends.   Approximating the value of a limit   Graphically and numerically approximate the limit of as approaches , where .    Video solution     Again we graph and create a table of its values near to approximate the limit. Note that this is a piecewise defined function, so it behaves differently on either side of . Figure shows a graph of , and on either side of it seems the values approach . Note that is not actually defined, as indicated in the graph with the open circle.    Graphically approximating a limit in Example         Numerically approximating a limit in Example                                   Figure shows values of for values of near . It is clear that as takes on values very near , takes on values very near . It turns out that if we let for either piece of , is returned; this is significant and we'll return to this idea later.  The graph and table allow us to say that ; in fact, we are probably very sure it equals 1.      Identifying When Limits Do Not Exist   Video introduction for    A function may not have a limit for all values of . That is, we cannot write that (where is some real number) for all values of , for there may not be a number that is approaching. There are three common ways in which a limit may fail to exist. limit does not exist    The function may approach different values on either side of .    The function may grow without upper or lower bound as approaches .    The function may oscillate as approaches without approaching a specific value.   We'll explore each of these in turn.   Different Values Approached From Left and Right   Explore why does not exist, where .    A graph of around and a table are given in Figures and , respectively. It is clear that as approaches , does not seem to approach a single number. Instead, it seems as though approaches two different numbers. When considering values of less than (approaching from the left), it seems that is approaching ; when considering values of greater than (approaching from the right), it seems that is approaching . Recognizing this behavior is important; we'll study this in greater depth later. Right now, it suffices to say that the limit does not exist since is approaching two different values as approaches .    Observing no limit as in Example         Values of near in Example                                     The Function Grows Without Bound   Explore why does not exist.    A graph and table of are given in Figure and Figure , respectively. Both show that as approaches , grows larger and larger.    Observing no limit as in Example         Values of near in Example         .     .             .     .      We can deduce this on our own, without the aid of the graph and table. If is near 1, then is very small, and: .  Since is not approaching a single number, we conclude that does not exist.     Video presentation for Examples     The Function Oscillates   Explore why does not exist.    Video solution     Two graphs of are given in Figure . Figure shows on the interval ; notice how seems to oscillate near . One might think that despite the oscillation, as approaches , approaches . However, Figure zooms in on , on the interval . Here the oscillation is even more pronounced. Finally, in Figure , we see evaluated for values of near . As approaches , does not appear to approach any value.   Observing that has no limit as in Example                      Observing that has no limit as in Example                                     It can be shown that in reality, as approaches 0, takes on all values between and infinitely many times! Because of this oscillation, does not exist.      Limits of Difference Quotients  We have approximated limits of functions as approached a particular number. We will consider another important kind of limit after explaining a few key ideas. limit difference quotient    Video introduction to    Let represent the position function, in feet, of some particle that is moving in a straight line, where is measured in seconds. Let's say that when , the particle is at position ft., and when , the particle is at ft. Another way of expressing this is to say    and .   Since the particle traveled feet in seconds, we can say the particle's average velocity  velocity average velocity  average velocity was ft\/s. We write this calculation using a quotient of differences, or, a difference quotient  difference quotient : .  This difference quotient can be thought of as the familiar rise over run used to compute the slopes of lines. In fact, that is essentially what we are doing: given two points on the graph of , we are finding the slope of the secant line through those two points. See Figure .   Interpreting a difference quotient as the slope of a secant line        Now consider finding the average speed on another time interval. We again start at , but consider the position of the particle seconds later. That is, consider the positions of the particle when and when . The difference quotient (excluding units) is now .  Let ; note that and , as in our discussion. We can compute this difference quotient for all values of (even negative values!) except , for then we get 0\/0, the indeterminate form introduced earlier. For all values , the difference quotient computes the average velocity of the particle over an interval of time of length starting at .  For small values of , , values of close to , we get average velocities over very short time periods and compute secant lines over small intervals. See Figure . This leads us to wonder what the limit of the difference quotient is as approaches . That is,     Secant lines of at and , for shrinking values of ( , )                             As we do not yet have a true definition of a limit nor an exact method for computing it, we settle for approximating the value. While we could graph the difference quotient (where the -axis would represent values and the -axis would represent values of the difference quotient) we settle for making a table. See . The table gives us reason to assume the value of the limit is about .   The difference quotient evaluated at values of near                                  Video examples for difference quotients: once with direct computation, and then by simplifying first    Proper understanding of limits is key to understanding calculus. With limits, we can accomplish seemingly impossible mathematical things, like adding up an infinite number of numbers (and not get infinity) and finding the slope of a line between two points, where the two points are actually the same point. These are not just mathematical curiosities; they allow us to link position, velocity and acceleration together, connect cross-sectional areas to volume, find the work done by a variable force, and much more.  In the next section we give the formal definition of the limit and begin our study of finding limits analytically. In the following exercises, we continue our introduction and approximate the value of limits.     Terms and Concepts    In your own words, what does it mean to find the limit of as approaches 3 ?         An expression of the form is called .                ?    True    False   The limit of as approaches is        False: the limit considers values of  near to but not equal to         Describe three situations where does not exist.   The function may approach different values from the left and right, the function may grow without bound, or the function might oscillate.         In your own words, what is a difference quotient?         When is near  is near what value?

Many refer to this as the epsilon-delta definition, referring to the letters and of the Greek alphabet.    Note: the common phrase the - definition is read aloud as the epsilon delta definition. The hyphen between and is not a minus sign.    An informal definition of the limit    Before we give the actual definition, let's consider a few informal ways of describing a limit. Given a function and an -value, , we say that the limit of the function , as approaches , is a value if:   Tends   tends to as tends to .     Approaches   approaches as approaches .     Near   is near whenever is near .      The problem with these definitions is that the words tends,  approach, and especially near are not exact. In what way does the variable tend to, or approach, ? How near do and have to be to and , respectively?  The definition we describe in this section comes from formalizing Near . A quick restatement gets us closer to what we want:   Tolerance Levels  If is within a certain tolerance level of , then the corresponding value is within a certain tolerance level of .     The traditional notation for the -tolerance is the lowercase Greek letter delta, or , and the -tolerance is denoted by lowercase epsilon, or . One more rephrasing of Tolerance Levels nearly gets us to the actual definition:   Named Tolerance Levels  If is within units of , then the corresponding value of is within units of .     We can write is within units of mathematically as , which is equivalent to .  Letting the symbol represent the word implies, we can rewrite Named Tolerance Levels as or .  The point is that and , being tolerances, can be any positive (but typically small) values satisfying this implication. Finally, we have the formal definition of the limit with the notation seen in the previous section.   The Limit of a Function at a point   Let be an open interval containing , and let be a function defined on , except possibly at . The statement that the limit of , as approaches , is is denoted by , and means that given any , there exists such that for all in , where , if , then . limit definition      Video presentation of    Mathematicians often enjoy writing ideas without using any words. Here is the wordless definition of the limit: .  Note the order in which and are given. In the definition, the -tolerance is given first and then the limit will exist if we can find an -tolerance that works.  An example will help us understand this definition. Note that the explanation is long, but it will take one through all steps necessary to understand the ideas.   Evaluating a limit using the definition   Show that .    Video solution     Before we use the formal definition, let's try some numerical tolerances. What if the tolerance is , or in other words ? How close to does have to be so that is within units of ? That is, ? In this case, we can proceed as follows:   So, what is the desired tolerance? Remember, we want to find a so that is smaller than . Since , then if we require , then we have Therefore we can have . See Figure .   Illustrating the process. With , we pick any                 Given the tolerance , we have found an tolerance, , such that whenever is within units of , then is within units of . That's what we were trying to find.  Let's try another value of .  What if the tolerance is , ? How close to does have to be in order for to be within units of ? (In other words for ?) Again, we just square these values to get , or   What is the desired tolerance? In this case we must have , which is the minimum distance from of the two bounds given above.  What we have so far: if , then leads to being less than from and if , then being less than from . A pattern is not easy to see, so we switch to general try to determine an adequate symbolically. We start by assuming is within units of :   The desired form in the last step is . Since we want this last interval to describe an tolerance around 4, we have that either or , whichever is smaller: .  Since , we have , the minimum is . That's the formula: given an , set .  We can check this for our previous values. If , the formula gives and when , the formula gives .  So given any , set . Then if (and ), then , satisfying the definition of the limit. We have shown formally (and finally!) that .    The previous example was a little long in that we sampled a few specific cases of before handling the general case. Normally this is not done. The previous example is also a bit unsatisfying in that ; why work so hard to prove something so obvious? Many - proofs are long and difficult to do. In this section, we will focus on examples where the answer is, frankly, obvious, because the non-obvious examples are even harder. In the next section we will learn some theorems that allow us to evaluate limits analytically , that is, without using the - definition.   Evaluating a limit using the definition   Show that .    Video solution     Let's do this example symbolically from the start. Let be given; we want , , . How do we find such that when , we are guaranteed that ?  This is a bit trickier than the previous example, but let's start by noticing that . Consider: .  Could we not set ?  We are close to an answer, but the catch is that must be a constant value (so it can't depend on ). There is a way to work around this, but we do have to make an assumption. Remember that is supposed to be a small number, which implies that will also be a small value. In particular, we can (probably) assume that . If this is true, then would imply that , giving .  Now, back to the fraction . If , then (add to all terms in the inequality). Taking reciprocals, we have , which implies , which implies .  This suggests that we set . To see why, let consider what follows when we assume :   We have arrived at as desired. Note again, in order to make this happen we needed to first be less than . That is a safe assumption; we want to be arbitrarily small, forcing to also be small.  We have also picked to be smaller than necessary. We could get by with a slightly larger , as shown in Figure . The outer lines show the boundaries defined by our choice of . The inner lines show the boundaries defined by setting . Note how these dotted lines are within the dashed lines. That is perfectly fine; by choosing within the dotted lines we are guaranteed that will be within of .   Choosing in Example        In summary, given , set . Then implies ( ) as desired. This shows that . Figure gives a visualization of this; by restricting to values within of , we see that is within of .    Make note of the general pattern exhibited in these last two examples. In some sense, each starts out backwards. That is, while we want to   start with and conclude that     ,     we actually start by doing what is essentially some scratch-work first:   assume , then perform some algebraic manipulations to give an inequality of the form      something .     When we have properly done this, the something on the greater than side of the inequality becomes our . We can refer to this as the scratch-work phase of our proof. Once we have , we can formally start the actual proof with and use algebraic manipulations to conclude that , usually by using the same steps of our scratch-work in reverse order.  We highlight this process in the following example.   Evaluating a limit using the definition   Prove that .    Video solution     We start our scratch-work by considering : .  We are at the phase of saying that  something , where . We want to turn that something into .  Since is approaching , we are safe to assume that is between and . So   In Inequality , we wanted . The above shows that given any in , we know that .  So we set . This ends our scratch-work, and we begin the formal proof (which also helps us understand why this was a good choice of ).  Given , let . We want to show that when , then . We start with : , which is what we wanted to show. Thus .    We illustrate evaluating limits once more.   Evaluating a limit using the definition   Prove that .    Symbolically, we want to take the inequality and unravel it to the form . Here is our scratch-work:   Making the safe assumption that ensures the last inequality is valid ( , so that is defined). We can then set to be the minimum of and ; , .   Recall and when . So is negative because ; hence we consider its absolute value: . To determine which is smaller between and amounts to determining which is smaller between and . But , so . And therefore .   Now, we work through the actual the proof:   In summary, given , let . Then implies as desired. We have shown that .    We note that we could actually show that for any constant . We do this by factoring out from both sides, leaving us to show instead. By using the substitution , this reduces to showing which we just did in the last example. As an added benefit, this shows that in fact the function is continuous at all values of , an important concept we will define in Section .  This formal definition of the limit is not an easy concept grasp. Our examples are actually easy examples, using simple functions like polynomials, square roots and exponentials. It is very difficult to prove, using the techniques given above, that , as we approximated in Section .  There is hope. Section shows how one can evaluate complicated limits using certain basic limits as building blocks. While limits are an incredibly important part of calculus (and hence much of higher mathematics), rarely are limits evaluated using the definition. Rather, the techniques of Section are employed.    Terms and Concepts    What is wrong with the following definition of a limit?  The limit of as approaches is means that given any there exists such that whenever we have   should be given first, and the restriction implies not the other way around.         Which is given first in establishing a limit?    ?    x-tolerance    y-tolerance                  ?    True    False    must always be positive.                ?

  "body": " Finding Limits Analytically  In Section we explored the concept of the limit without a strict definition, meaning we could only make approximations. In the previous section we gave the definition of the limit and demonstrated how to use it to verify our approximations were correct. Thus far, our method of finding a limit is  make a really good approximation either graphically or numerically, and  verify our approximation is correct using a - proof.    Recognizing that - proofs are cumbersome, this section gives a series of theorems which allow us to find limits much more quickly and intuitively.  Suppose that and . What is ? Intuition tells us that the limit should be , as we expect limits to behave in a nice way. The following theorem states that already established limits do behave nicely.   Basic Limit Properties   Let , , and be real numbers, let be a positive integer, and let and be functions defined on an open interval containing with the following limits: limit properties  .  The following limits hold.   Constants       Identity       Sums\/Differences       Scalar Multiples       Products       Quotients   , when     Powers       Roots     (If is even then require on .)    Compositions  Adjust the limit requirements to . Then .        Video presentation of (three videos)     Many people like to remember the Sum Property as stating that the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits , and the Product Property as stating that the limit of a product is the product of the limits.   In practice, the Scalar Multiple Property is often viewed as telling us that we can take constants out of limits :    We apply the theorem to an example.   Using basic limit properties   Let . Find the following limits:             Video solution        Using the property, we know that .    Using the , , and properties, we find that .    Here we combine the , , and properties. We show quite a few steps, but in general these can be omitted:         Part of the previous example demonstrates how the limit of a quadratic polynomial can be determined using the properties of Theorem . Not only that, recognize that  , the limit at could have been found just by plugging into the function. This holds true for all polynomials, and also for rational functions (which are quotients of polynomials), as stated in the following theorem.    Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions   Let and be polynomials and a real number. Then: limit of polynomial functions  limit of rational functions  continuity of polynomial functions  continuity of rational functions  polynomial function continuity of  rational function continuity of          , when .        Video presentation of and     Finding a limit of a rational function   Using Theorem , find .    Using Theorem , we can quickly state that .    It was likely frustrating in Section to do a lot of work with and to prove that as it seemed fairly obvious. The previous theorems state that many functions behave in such an obvious fashion, as demonstrated by the rational function in Example .  Polynomial and rational functions are not the only functions to behave in such a predictable way. The following theorem gives a list of functions whose behavior is particularly nice in terms of limits. In Section , we will give a formal name to these functions that behave nicely.     Limits of Common Functions   Let be a real number in the domain of the given function and let be a positive integer. The following limits hold: limit of trigonometric functions  limit of exponential functions  limit of logarithmic functions  continuity of trigonometric functions  continuity of exponential functions  continuity of logarithmic functions  trigonometric function continuity of  exponential function continuity of  logarithmic function continuity of         , if    ( follows from the and rules.)     Evaluating limits analytically   Evaluate the following limits.              This is a straightforward application of Theorem : .    We can approach this in at least two ways. First, by directly applying Theorem , we have: . Using the Pythagorean Theorem, this last expression is ; therefore .  We can also use the Pythagorean Theorem from the start. , using the rule. Either way, we find the limit is .    Applying the rule and Theorem gives .    Again, we can approach this in two ways. First, we can use the exponential\/logarithmic identity that and evaluate .  We can also use the rule. Using Theorem , we have and , satisfying the conditions of the rule. Applying this rule, . Both approaches are valid, giving the same result.    We encountered this limit in Section . Applying our theorems, we attempt to find the limit as , which is of the form . This, of course, violates a condition of the rule, as the limit of the denominator is not allowed to be . Therefore, we are still unable to evaluate this limit with tools we currently have at hand.       Based on what we've done so far, this section could have been titled Using Known Limits to Find Unknown Limits. By knowing certain limits of functions, we can find limits involving sums, products, powers, , of these functions. We further the development of such comparative tools with the Squeeze Theorem, a clever and intuitive way to find the value of some limits.  Before stating this theorem formally, suppose we have functions , , and where always takes on values between and ; that is, for all in an interval, .  If and have the same limit at , and is always squeezed between them, then must have the same limit as well. That is what the Squeeze Theorem states. This is illustrated in Figure .   An illustration of the Squeeze Theorem        Squeeze Theorem   Let , and be functions on an open interval containing such that for all in , . limit Squeeze Theorem  Squeeze Theorem If , then .     Explaining the Squeeze Theorem    It can take some work to figure out appropriate functions by which to squeeze a given function. However, that is generally the only place where work is necessary; the theorem makes the evaluating the limit part very simple.  The Squeeze Theorem can be used to show that limits of can be done by direct substitution, as the videos in illustrate.   Using the Squeeze Theorem to take limits of    We use the in the following example to finally prove that .   Using the Squeeze Theorem   Use the to show that .    Video solution     We begin by considering the unit circle. Each point on the unit circle has coordinates for some angle as shown in Figure . Using similar triangles, we can extend the line from the origin through the point to the point , as shown. (Here we are assuming that . Later we will show that we can also consider .)   The unit circle and related triangles          Figure shows three regions have been constructed in the first quadrant, two triangles and a sector of a circle, which are also drawn below. The area of the large triangle is ; the area of the sector is ; the area of the triangle contained inside the sector is . It is then clear from Figure that . (You may need to recall that the area of a sector of a circle is with measured in radians.)   Bounding the sector between two triangles                       Multiply all terms by , giving .  Taking reciprocals reverses the inequalities, giving . (These inequalities hold for all values of near , even negative values, since and .)  Now take limits.   Clearly this means that .    With the limit finally established, we can move on to other limits involving trigonometric functions, as the video in demonstrates.   Finding limits involving trigonometric functions    Two notes about the Example are worth mentioning. First, one might be discouraged by this application, thinking I would never have come up with that on my own. This is too hard! Don't be discouraged; within this text we will guide you in your use of the . As one gains mathematical maturity, clever proofs like this are easier and easier to create.  Second, this limit tells us more than just that as approaches , approaches . Both and are approaching , but the ratio of and approaches , meaning that they are approaching in essentially the same way. Another way of viewing this is: for small , the functions and are essentially indistinguishable.   We include this special limit, along with three others, in the following theorem.   Special Limits             A short word on how to interpret the latter three limits. We know that as goes to , goes to . So, in the second limit, both the numerator and denominator are approaching . However, since the limit is , we can interpret this as saying that is approaching faster than is approaching .   In the third limit, inside the parentheses we have an expression that is approaching (though never equaling ), and we know that raised to any power is still . At the same time, the power is growing toward infinity. What happens to a number near raised to a very large power? In this particular case, the result approaches Euler's number, , approximately .  In the fourth limit, we see that as , approaches  just as fast as , resulting in a limit of .  The special limits stated in Theorem are called indeterminate forms ; limit indeterminate form in this case they are of the form , except the third limit, which is of a different form. You'll learn techniques to find these limits exactly using calculus in Section .  Our final theorem for this section will be motivated by the following example.   Using algebra to evaluate a limit   Evaluate the following limit: .    We begin by attempting to apply Theorem and substituting for in the quotient. This gives: which is of the form , an indeterminate form. We cannot apply the theorem.  By graphing the function, as in Figure , we see that the function seems to be linear, implying that the limit should be easy to evaluate. Recognize that the numerator of our quotient can be factored: . The function is not defined when , but for all other ,    Graphing in Example to understand a limit         Clearly . Recall that when considering limits, we are not concerned with the value of the function at , only the value the function approaches as approaches . Since and are the same at all points except at , they both approach the same value as approaches . Therefore we can conclude that     The key to Example is that the functions and are identical except at . Since limits describe a value the function is approaching, not the value the function actually attains, the limits of the two functions are always equal.   Limits of Functions Equal At All But One Point   Let for all in an open interval, except possibly at , and let for some real number . Then .    The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra tells us that when dealing with a rational function of the form and directly evaluating the limit returns 0\/0 , then is a factor of both and . One can then use algebra to factor this binomial out, cancel, then apply Theorem . We demonstrate this once more.   Evaluating a limit using Theorem   Evaluate .    Video solution     We attempt to apply Theorem by substituting for . This returns the familiar indeterminate form of 0\/0 . Since the numerator and denominator are each polynomials, we know that is factor of each. Using whatever method is most comfortable to you, factor out from each (using polynomial division, synthetic division, a computer algebra system, etc.). We find that . We can cancel the factors as long as . Using Theorem we conclude: .     Evaluating a Limit with a Hole   Evaluate .    Video solution     We begin by trying to apply the limit rule, but the denominator evaluates to zero. In fact, this limit is of the indeterminate form . We will do some algebra to resolve the indeterminate form. In this case, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the numerator. We can cancel the factors as long as . Using Theorem we conclude: .    We end this section by revisiting a limit first seen in Section , a limit of a difference quotient. Let ; we approximated the limit . We formally evaluate this limit in the following example.   Evaluating the limit of a difference quotient   Let ; find .    Since is a polynomial, our first attempt should be to employ Theorem and substitute for . However, we see that this gives us . Knowing that we have a rational function hints that some algebra will help. Consider the following steps: This matches our previous approximation.    This section contains several valuable tools for evaluating limits. One of the main results of this section is Theorem ; it states that many functions that we use regularly behave in a very nice, predictable way. In Section we give a name to this nice behavior; we label such functions as continuous . Defining that term will require us to look again at what a limit is and what causes limits to not exist.

  "title": "One-Sided Limits",
  "body": " One-Sided Limits  We introduced the concept of a limit gently, approximating their values graphically and numerically. Next came the rigorous definition of the limit, along with an admittedly tedious method for evaluating them. Section gave us tools (which we call theorems) that allow us to compute limits with greater ease. Chief among the results were the facts that polynomials and rational, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions (and their sums, products, etc.) all behave nicely. In this section we rigorously define what we mean by nicely.   In Section we saw three ways in which limits of functions can fail to exist:   The function approaches different values from the left and right.    The function grows without bound.    The function oscillates.     In this section we explore in depth the concepts behind by introducing the one-sided limit . We begin with formal definitions that are very similar to the definition of the limit given in Section , but the notation is slightly different and is replaced with either or .   There is a slightly different definition for a left-hand limit, than for a right-hand limit, but both have a lot in common with .   One Sided Limits: Left- and Right-Hand Limits      Left-Hand Limit  limit one-sided  limit left-handed  Let be a function defined on for some and let be a real number. The statement that the limit of , as approaches  from the left , is , (alternatively, that the left-hand limit of at is ) is denoted by , and means that for any , there exists such that for all , if , then .    Right-Hand Limit  limit one-sided  limit right-handed  Let be a function defined on for some and let be a real number. The statement that the limit of , as approaches  from the right , is , (alternatively, that the right-hand limit of at is ) is denoted by , and means that for any , there exists such that for all , if , then .        Video presentation of    Practically speaking, when evaluating a left-hand limit, we consider only values of  to the left of ,  , where . The admittedly imperfect notation is used to imply that we look at values of to the left of . The notation has nothing to do with positive or negative values of either or . It's more like you are adding very small negative values to to get values for . A similar statement holds for evaluating right-hand limits; there we consider only values of to the right of , , . We can use the theorems from previous sections to help us evaluate these limits; we just restrict our view to one side of .  We practice evaluating left- and right-hand limits through a series of examples.   Evaluating one-sided limits   Let , as shown in Figure . Find each of the following:                             A graph of in Example           Video solution     For these problems, the visual aid of the graph is likely more effective in evaluating the limits than using itself. Therefore we will refer often to the graph.     As goes to  from the left , we see that is approaching the value of .  Therefore .     As goes to  from the right , we see that is approaching the value of . Recall that it does not matter that there is an open circle there; we are evaluating a limit, not the value of the function.  Therefore .     The limit of as approaches does not exist, as discussed in Section . The function does not approach one particular value, but two different values from the left and the right.    Using the definition, and by looking at the graph, we see that .    As goes to from the right, we see that is approaching . Therefore . Note we cannot consider a left-hand limit at as is not defined for values of .    Using the definition and the graph, .    As goes to from the left, we see that is approaching the value of .  Therefore .    The graph and the definition of the function show that is not defined.       Note how the left- and right-hand limits were different at . This, of course, causes the limit to not exist. The following theorem states what is fairly intuitive: the limit exists precisely when the left- and right-hand limits are equal.   Limits and One-Sided Limits   Let be a function defined on an open interval containing . limit does not exist Then if, and only if, .    The phrase if, and only if means the two statements are equivalent : they are either both true or both false. If the limit equals , then the left and right hand limits both equal . If the limit is not equal to , then at least one of the left and right-hand limits is not equal to (it may not even exist).  One thing to consider in Examples - is that the value of the function may\/may not be equal to the value(s) of its left\/right-hand limits, even when these limits agree.   Evaluating limits of a piecewise-defined function   Let . Evaluate the following:                              Video solution     In this example, we evaluate each expression using just the definition of , without using a graph as we did in the previous example.     As approaches from the left, we consider a limit where all -values are less than . This means we use the piece of the piecewise-defined function . As the -values near , approaches ; that is, approaches .  Therefore   A concise mathematical presentation of the above argument could be written as follows:      As approaches from the right, we consider a limit where all -values are greater than . This means we use the piece of . As the -values near , approaches ; that is, we see that again approaches .  Therefore .  Once again, we can present our work computationally as follows:       The limit of as approaches exists and is , as approaches from both the right and left.  Therefore .    Neither piece of is defined for the -value of ; in other words, is not in the domain of . Therefore is not defined.     As approaches from the right, we consider a limit where all -values are greater than . This means we use the piece of . As the -values near , approaches ; that is, approaches .  So .      is not defined as is not in the domain of .    As approaches from the left, we consider a limit where all -values are less than . This means we use the piece of . As the -values near , nears ; that is, approaches .  So .      is not defined as is not in the domain of .     We can confirm our analytic result by consulting the graph of shown in Figure . Note the open circles on the graph at , and , where is not defined.   A graph of from Example            Evaluating limits of a piecewise-defined function   Let as shown in Figure . Evaluate the following:                 Graphing in Example           Video solution     It is clear by looking at the graph that both the left- and right-hand limits of , as approaches , are . Thus it is also clear that the limit is ; , . It is also clearly stated that .     Evaluating limits of a piecewise-defined function   Let as shown in Figure . Evaluate the following:                 Graphing in Example           Video solution     It is clear from the definition of the function and its graph that all of the following are equal: .    In Examples - we were asked to find both and . Consider the following table:         Example  does not exist     Example   not defined    Example      Example      Only in Example do both the function and the limit exist and agree. This seems nice; in fact, it seems normal. This is in fact an important situation which we explore in Section entitled Continuity. In short, a continuous function is one in which when a function approaches a value as ( , when ), it actually attains that value at . Such functions behave nicely as they are very predictable.    Terms and Concepts    What are the three ways in which a limit may fail to exist?   The function approaches different values from the left and right; the function grows without bound; the function oscillates.           ?    True    False   If then        False: the right-hand limit might not equal           ?    True    False   If then        False: just because the left-hand limit equals some number, that doesn t mean the right-hand limit exists or equals the same number.           ?    True    False   If then        True: When the limit exists, both the left-hand and right-hand limits also exist and have the same value.

  "body": " Continuity  As we have studied limits, we have gained the intuition that limits measure where a function is heading. That is, if , then as is close to , is close to . We have seen, though, that this is not necessarily a good indicator of what actually is. This can be problematic; functions can tend to one value but attain another. This section focuses on functions that do not exhibit such behavior.   Continuous Function   Let be a function whose domain contains an open interval . continuous function  function continuous     is continuous at a point  in if . continuous at a point      is continuous on the open interval  if is continuous at for all values of in . continuous on an interval If is continuous on , we say is continuous everywhere (or everywhere continuous ). continuous everywhere  everywhere continuous        Note that in , a function can only be continuous at a point if is in the domain of .   Video presentation of    A useful way to establish whether or not a function is continuous at is to verify the following three things:    exists,     is defined, and     .      Finding intervals of continuity   Let be defined as shown in Figure . Give the interval(s) on which is continuous.   A graph of in Example           We proceed by examining the three criteria for continuity.   The limits exists for all between and .     is defined for all between and , except for  . We know immediately that cannot be continuous at .    The limit for all between and , except, of course, for .     We conclude that is continuous at every point of the interval except at . Therefore is continuous on and .   Our definition of continuity (currently) only applies to open intervals. After Definition , we'll be able to say that is continuous on and .      Finding intervals of continuity   The floor function , floor function  function floor  , returns the largest integer smaller than, or equal to, the input . (For example, .) The graph of in Figure demonstrates why this is often called a step function.   Give the intervals on which is continuous.   A graph of the step function in Example           We examine the three criteria for continuity.   The limits do not exist at the jumps from one step to the next, which occur at all integer values of . Therefore the limits exist for all except when is an integer.    The function is defined for all values of .    The limit for all values of where the limit exist, since each step consists of just a line.     We conclude that is continuous everywhere except at integer values of . So the intervals on which is continuous are . We could also say that is continuous on all intervals of the form where is an integer.    Our definition of continuity on an interval specifies the interval is an open interval. We can extend the definition of continuity to closed intervals of the form by considering the appropriate one-sided limits at the endpoints.   In this text, when we use the term closed interval , we mean an interval of the form , where and are real numbers. One may be surprised to learn that intervals of the form , and even are all also considered closed in advanced calculus. While the mathematics supported by this definition of closed is fascinating and important, it is beyond the scope of our purposes here.  Some results, such as , are valid for intervals of the form , but not for intervals such as . The latter interval is closed, but not bounded . bounded interval   A set of real numbers is bounded if there is a number that is greater than every element in the set (an upper bound), and a number that is less than every element in the set (a lower bound). When we do calculus in higher dimensions, we can no longer talk about intervals, but we can still talk about sets being closed and bounded. See for details.    Continuity on Closed Intervals   Let be defined on the closed interval for some real numbers .  We say is continuous on the closed interval  if:    is continuous on ,     and     .       We can make the appropriate adjustments to talk about continuity on half-open intervals such as or if necessary.  If the domain of includes values less than , we say that Item in indicates that is continuous from the right at . But if is undefined for , we can say that is continuous at without ambiguity.  Similarly, Item indcates that is continuous from the left at , and if is not defined for , we can simply say that is continuous at .  For example, it makes sense to say that the function is continuous at and , while the floor function in is continuous from the left at and , but is not continuous at these points.  Using this new definition, we can adjust our answer in Example by stating that is continuous on and , as mentioned in that example. We can also revisit Example and state that the floor function is continuous on the following half-open intervals .   Two continuity examples    This can tempt us to conclude that is continuous everywhere; after all, if is continuous on and , isn't also continuous on ? Of course, the answer is no , and the graph of the floor function immediately confirms this.  Continuous functions are important as they behave in a predictable fashion: functions attain the value they approach. Because continuity is so important, most of the functions you have likely seen in the past are continuous on their domains. This is demonstrated in the following example where we examine the intervals of continuity of a variety of common functions.   Determining intervals on which a function is continuous   For each of the following functions, give the domain of the function and the interval(s) on which it is continuous.                               Video solution     We examine each in turn.   The domain of is . As it is a rational function, we apply Theorem to recognize that is continuous on all of its domain.    The domain of is all real numbers, or . Applying Theorem shows that is continuous everywhere.    The domain of is . Applying Theorem shows that is continuous on its domain of .    The domain of is . Applying Theorems and shows that is continuous on all of its domain, .    The domain of is . We can define the absolute value function as . Each piece of this piecewise defined function is continuous on all of its domain, giving that is continuous on and . We cannot assume this implies that is continuous on ; we need to check that , as is the point where transitions from one piece of its definition to the other. It is easy to verify that this is indeed true, hence we conclude that is continuous everywhere.       Continuity is inherently tied to the properties of limits. Because of this, the properties of limits found in Theorems and apply to continuity as well. Further, now knowing the definition of continuity we can re-read Theorem as giving a list of functions that are continuous on their domains. The following theorem states how continuous functions can be combined to form other continuous functions, followed by a theorem which formally lists functions that we know are continuous on their domains.   Properties of Continuous Functions   Let and be continuous functions on an interval , let be a real number and let be a positive integer. The following functions are continuous on .   Sums\/Difference       Constant Multiple       Product       Quotient   (as long as on )    Power       Root   (If is even then require on .)    Compositions  Adjust the definitions of and to: Let be continuous on , where the range of on is , and let be continuous on . Then , , , is continuous on .         Video presentation of     We have defined what it means for a function to be continuous on an interval, but many functions, such as , have domains that are the union of more than one interval.  If the domain of a function is a union of intervals, saying that a function is continuous on its domain means that the function is continuous on each of those intervals. But be careful to note that the converse is not true. As we learned in , a function can be continuous on a collection of intervals, but not on their union.    Continuous Functions   Let be a positive integer. The following functions are continuous on their domains. continuous function properties                         ( )                    , where is a positive integer.       As the video example in illustrates, the above theorems allow us to quickly construct new continuous functions from old ones.   Continuity of compositions    We apply these theorems in the following Example.   Determining intervals on which a function is continuous   State the interval(s) on which each of the following functions is continuous.                          Video solution     We examine each in turn, applying Theorems and as appropriate.   A graph of            The square root terms are continuous on the intervals and , respectively. As is continuous only where each term is continuous, is continuous on , the intersection of these two intervals. A graph of is given in Figure .    The functions and are each continuous everywhere, hence their product is, too.     Theorem states that is continuous on its domain . Its domain includes all real numbers except odd multiples of . Thus the intervals on which is continuous are .    Here, is the composition , where and . The domain of is , while the range of is . If we restrict the domain to , then the output from is restricted to , on which is defined. Thus the domain of is .        Classification of discontinuities  We now know what it means for a function to be continuous, so of course we can easily say what it means for a function to be discontinuous ; namely, not continuous. However, to better understand continuity, it is worth our time to discuss the different ways in which a function can fail to be discontinuous. By definition, a function is continuous at a point in its domain if . If this equality fails to hold, then is not continuous. We note, however, that there are a number of different things that can go wrong with this equality.   Discussing classification of discontinuities        exists, but , or is undefined. Such a discontinuity is called a removable discontinuity  discontinuity removable .  A removable discontinuity can be pictured as a hole in the graph of . The term removable refers to the fact that by simply redefining to equal (that is, changing the value of at a single point), we can create a new function that is continuous at , and agrees with at all .     and exist, but . In this case the left and right hand limits both exist, but since they are not equal, the limit of as does not exist. Such a discontinuity is called a jump discontinuity . discontinuity jump   The phrase jump discontinuity is meant to represent the fact that visually, the graph of  jumps from one value to another as we cross the value .    The function is unbounded near . This means that the value of becomes arbitrarily large (or large and negative) as approaches . Such a discontinuity is called an infinite discontinuity . discontinuity infinite   Infinite discontinuities are most easily understood in terms of infinite limits , which are discussed in Section .      Illustrating three common types of discontinuity    The graph of a function with a removable discontinuity at        The graph of a function with a jump discontinuity at        The graph of a function with an infinite discontinuity at           Consequences of continuity  A common way of thinking of a continuous function is that its graph can be sketched without lifting your pencil. That is, its graph forms a continuous curve, without holes, breaks or jumps. This pseudo-definition glosses over some of the finer points of continuity. There are some very strange continuous functions that one would be hard pressed to actually sketch by hand.  However, this intuitive notion of continuity does help us understand another important concept as follows. Suppose is defined on , and and . If is continuous on ( , its graph can be sketched as a continuous curve from to ) then we know intuitively that somewhere on the interval  must be equal to , and , and , etc. In short, takes on all intermediate values between and . It may take on more values; may actually equal at some time, for instance, but we are guaranteed all values between and .   Illustration of the Intermediate Value Theorem: the output is in between and , and therefore any continuous function on with and will achieve the output somewhere in       While this notion seems intuitive, it is not trivial to prove and its importance is profound. Therefore the concept is stated in the form of a theorem.   Intermediate Value Theorem   Let be a continuous function on and, without loss of generality, let . Then for every value , where , there is at least one value in such that . Intermediate Value Theorem  theorem Intermediate Value      Video presentation of    One important application of the is root finding. Given a function , we are often interested in finding values of where . These roots may be very difficult to find exactly. Good approximations can be found through successive applications of this theorem. Suppose through direct computation we find that and , where . The states that there is at least one in such that . The theorem does not give us any clue as to where to find such a value in the interval , just that at least one such value exists.  There is a technique that produces a good approximation of . Let be the midpoint of the interval , with and and consider . There are three possibilities:    : We got lucky and stumbled on the actual value. We stop as we found a root.     : Then we know there is a root of on the interval  we have halved the size of our interval, hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.     : Then we know there is a root of on the interval  again,we have halved the size of our interval, hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.     Successively applying this technique is called the Bisection Method  Bisection Method of root finding. We continue until the interval is sufficiently small. We demonstrate this in the following example.   Using the Bisection Method   Approximate the root of , accurate to three places after the decimal.    Video solution     Consider the graph of , shown in Figure . It is clear that the graph crosses the -axis somewhere near . To start the Bisection Method, pick an interval that contains . We choose . Note that all we care about are signs of , not their actual value, so this is all we display.   Graphing a root of            Iteration 1:   , , and . So replace with and repeat.    Iteration 2:   , , and at the midpoint, , we have . So replace with and repeat. Note that we don't need to continue to check the endpoints, just the midpoint. Thus we put the rest of the iterations in Table .      Iterations of the Bisection Method of Root Finding    Iteration #  Interval  Midpoint Sign                                                                         Notice that in the 12th iteration we have the endpoints of the interval each starting with . Thus we have narrowed the zero down to an accuracy of the first three places after the decimal. Using a computer, we have .  Either endpoint of the interval gives a good approximation of where is . The states that the actual zero is still within this interval. While we do not know its exact value, we know it starts with .  This type of exercise is rarely done by hand. Rather, it is simple to program a computer to run such an algorithm and stop when the endpoints differ by a preset small amount. One of the authors did write such a program and found the zero of to be , accurate to places after the decimal. While it took a few minutes to write the program, it took less than a thousandth of a second for the program to run the necessary iterations. In less than hundredths of a second, the zero was calculated to decimal places (with less than iterations).     It is a simple matter to extend the Bisection Method to solve problems similar to Find , where . For instance, we can find , where . It actually works very well to define a new function where . Then use the Bisection Method to solve .  Similarly, given two functions and , we can use the Bisection Method to solve . Once again, create a new function where and solve .  In Section another equation solving method will be introduced, called Newton's Method. In many cases, Newton's Method is much faster. It relies on more advanced mathematics, though, so we will wait before introducing it.  This section formally defined what it means to be a continuous function. Most functions that we deal with are continuous, so often it feels odd to have to formally define this concept. Regardless, it is important, and forms the basis of the next chapter.      Terms and Concepts    In your own words, describe what it means for a function to be continuous.         In your own words, describe what the Intermediate Value Theorem states.

  "body": " Limits Involving Infinity   In Definition we stated that in the equation , both and were numbers. In this section we relax that definition a bit by considering situations when it makes sense to let and\/or be infinity.   As a motivating example, consider , as shown in Figure . Note how, as approaches 0, grows very, very large in fact, it grows without bound. It seems appropriate, and descriptive, to state that .  Also note that as gets very large, gets very, very small. We could represent this concept with notation such as .   Graphing for values of near 0         We explore both types of use of in turn.

The limit of , as approaches , is infinity , denoted by , if given any , there exists such that for all in , where , if , then .    The limit of , as approaches , is negative infinity , denoted by , if given any , there exists such that for all in , where , if , then .    limit of infinity      Video presentation of    The first definition is similar to the - definition in Definition from Section . In that definition, given any (small) value , if we let get close enough to (within units of ) then is guaranteed to be within of . Here, given any (large) value , if we let get close enough to (within units of ), then will be at least as large as . In other words, if we get close enough to , then we can make as large as we want.  It is important to note that by saying we are implicitly stating that the limit of , as approaches , does not exist. A limit only exists when approaches an actual numeric value. We use the concept of limits that approach infinity because it is helpful and descriptive. It is one specific way in which a limit can fail to exist.  We define one-sided limits that approach infinity in a similar way.   One-Sided Limits of Infinity      Let be a function defined on for some . We say the limit of , as approaches from the left, is infinity, or, the left-hand limit of at is infinity, denoted by , if given any , there exists such that for all , if , then .    Let be a function defined on for some . We say the limit of , as approaches from the right, is infinity, or, the right-hand limit of at is infinity, denoted by , if given any , there exists such that for all , if , then .    The term left- (or, right-) hand limit of at c is negative infinity is defined in a manner similar to Definition .        Evaluating limits involving infinity   Find as shown in Figure .   Observing infinite limit as in Example           Video solution     In Example of Section , by inspecting values of close to we concluded that this limit does not exist. That is, it cannot equal any real number. But the limit could be infinite. And in fact, we see that the function does appear to be growing larger and larger, as , , . A similar thing happens on the other side of . From the graph and the numeric information, we could state . We can prove this by using Definition   In general, let a large value be given. Let . If is within of , , if , then: , which is what we wanted to show. So we may say .     Evaluating limits involving infinity   Find , as shown in Figure .    Video solution     It is easy to see that the function grows without bound near , but it does so in different ways on different sides of . Since its behavior is not consistent, we cannot say that . Instead, we will say does not exist. However, we can make a statement about one-sided limits. We can state that and .   Evaluating             Vertical asymptotes  The graphs in the two previous examples demonstrate that if a function has a limit (or, left- or right-hand limit) of infinity at , then the graph of looks similar to a vertical line near . This observation leads to a definition.   Vertical Asymptote   Let be an interval that either contains or has as an endpoint, and let be a function defined on , except possibly at .  If the limit of as approaches from either the left or right (or both) is or , then the line is a vertical asymptote of . asymptote vertical      Video presentation of     Finding vertical asymptotes   Find the vertical asymptotes of .    Video solution     Vertical asymptotes occur where the function grows without bound; this can occur at values of where the denominator is . When is near , the denominator is small, which in turn can make the function take on large values. In the case of the given function, the denominator is at . Substituting in values of close to and seems to indicate that the function tends toward or at those points. We can graphically confirm this by looking at Figure . Thus the vertical asymptotes are at .   Graphing           When a rational function has a vertical asymptote at , we can conclude that the denominator is at . However, just because the denominator is at a certain point does not mean there is a vertical asymptote there. For instance, does not have a vertical asymptote at , as shown in Figure . While the denominator does get small near , the numerator gets small too, matching the denominator step for step. In fact, factoring the numerator, we get .  Canceling the common term, we get that for . So there is clearly no asymptote; rather, a hole exists in the graph at .   Graphically showing that does not have an asymptote at         The above example may seem a little contrived. Another example demonstrating this important concept is . We have considered this function several times in the previous sections. We found that ; , there is no vertical asymptote. No simple algebraic cancellation makes this fact obvious; we used the in Section to prove this.  If the denominator is at a certain point but the numerator is not, then there will usually be a vertical asymptote at that point. On the other hand, if the numerator and denominator are both zero at that point, then there may or may not be a vertical asymptote at that point. This case where the numerator and denominator are both zero returns us to an important topic.    Indeterminate Forms   limit indeterminate form  indeterminate form   We have seen how the limits and each return the indeterminate form when we blindly plug in and , respectively. However, is not a valid arithmetical expression. It gives no indication that the respective limits are and .  With a little cleverness, one can come up with expressions which have a limit of , 0, or any other real number. That is why this expression is called indeterminate .  A key concept to understand is that such limits do not really return . Rather, keep in mind that we are taking limits . What is really happening is that the numerator is shrinking to while the denominator is also shrinking to . The respective rates at which they do this are very important and determine the actual value of the limit.  An indeterminate form indicates that one needs to do more work in order to compute the limit. That work may be algebraic (such as factoring and canceling), it may involve using trigonometric identities or logarithm rules, or it may require a tool such as the . In Section we will learn yet another technique called L'Hospital's Rule that provides another way to handle indeterminate forms.  Some other common indeterminate forms are , , , , and . Again, keep in mind that these are the blind results of directly substituting into the expression, and each, in and of itself, has no meaning. The expression does not really mean subtract infinity from infinity. Rather, it means One quantity is subtracted from the other, but both are growing without bound. What is the result? It is possible to get every value between and .  Note that and are not indeterminate forms, though they are not exactly valid mathematical expressions, either. In each, the function is growing without bound, indicating that the limit will be , , or simply not exist if the left- and right-hand limits do not match.    Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes  At the beginning of this section we briefly considered what happens to as grew very large. Graphically, it concerns the behavior of the function to the far right of the graph. We make this notion more explicit in the following definition.   Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes   Let be a real number.   Let be a function defined on for some number . The limit of  at infinity is , denoted , if for every there exists such that if , then . limit at infinity  asymptote horizontal     Let be a function defined on for some number . The limit of  at negative infinity is , denoted , if for every there exists such that if , then .    If or , we say the line is a horizontal asymptote of .        Video presentation of    We can also define limits such as by combining this definition with Definition .   Approximating horizontal asymptotes   Approximate the horizontal asymptote(s) of .    We will approximate the horizontal asymptotes by approximating the limits and . (A rational function can have at most one horizontal asymptote. So we could get away with only taking ).   Figure shows a sketch of , and the table in Figure gives values of for large magnitude values of . It seems reasonable to conclude from both of these sources that has a horizontal asymptote at .   Using a graph and a table to approximate a horizontal asymptote in Example                                            Later, we will show how to determine this analytically.    The video in shows how to prove the result from using the limit definition.   Using an - proof with in    Horizontal asymptotes can take on a variety of forms. Figure shows that has a horizontal asymptote of , where is approached from both above and below.   Figure shows that has two horizontal asymptotes; one at and the other at .   Figure shows that has even more interesting behavior than at just ; as approaches , approaches , but oscillates as it does this.    Considering different types of horizontal asymptotes                                We can analytically evaluate limits at infinity for rational functions once we understand . As gets larger and larger, gets smaller and smaller, approaching . We can, in fact, make as small as we want by choosing a large enough value of . Given , we can make by choosing . Thus we have .  It is now not much of a jump to conclude the following: .   Basic examples involving limits at infinity    Now suppose we need to compute the following limit: .  A good way of approaching this is to divide through the numerator and denominator by (hence multiplying by ), which is the largest power of to appear in the denominator. Doing this, we get .  Then using the rules for limits (which also hold for limits at infinity), as well as the fact about limits of , we see that the limit becomes .  This procedure works for any rational function. In fact, it gives us the following theorem.   Limits of Rational Functions at Infinity   Let be a rational function of the following form: , where are positive integers and where any of the coefficients may be except for and . Then:   If , then .    If , then .    If , then and are both infinite.       We can see why this is true. If the highest power of is the same in both the numerator and denominator (  ), we will be in a situation like the example above, where we will divide by and in the limit all the terms will approach except for and . Since , this will leave us with the limit . If , then after dividing through by , all the terms in the numerator will approach in the limit, leaving us with or . If , and we try dividing through by , we end up with the denominator tending to while the numerator tends to .  Intuitively, as gets very large, all the terms in the numerator are small in comparison to , and likewise all the terms in the denominator are small compared to . If , looking only at these two important terms, we have . This reduces to . If , the function behaves like , which tends toward . If , the function behaves like , which will tend to either or depending on the values of , , , and whether you are looking for or .   Finding a limit of a rational function   Confirm analytically that is the horizontal asymptote of , as approximated in Example .    Video solution     Before using Theorem , let's use the technique of evaluating limits at infinity of rational functions that led to that theorem. The largest power of in is , so divide the numerator and denominator of by , then take limits. .  We can also use Theorem directly; in this case so the limit is the ratio of the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator, , 1\/1 = 1.     Finding limits of rational functions   Use Theorem to evaluate each of the following limits.            The highest power of is in the denominator. Therefore, the limit is ; see Figure .    The highest power of is , which occurs in both the numerator and denominator. The limit is therefore the ratio of the coefficients of , which is . See Figure .    The highest power of is in the numerator so the limit will be or . To see which, consider only the dominant terms from the numerator and denominator, which are and . The expression in the limit will behave like for large values of . Therefore, the limit is . See Figure .      Visualizing the functions in Example                                  With care, we can quickly evaluate limits at infinity for a large number of functions by considering the long run behavior using dominant terms of . For instance, consider again , graphed in Figure . The dominant terms are in the numerator and in the denominator. When is very large, . Thus .  This expression is when is positive and when is negative. Hence we get asymptotes of and , respectively. We will show this more formally in the next example.   Finding a limit using dominant terms   Confirm analytically that and are the horizontal asymptote of , as graphed in Figure .    The dominating term of in the denominator is so divide the numerator and denominator of by , then take limits. .  As , the only thing that changes is the value of . For , we have , making . Therefore, the horizontal asymptotes are and .    The video in provides another example similar to .   Limits at infinity with a radical function       Terms and Concepts      ?

Suppose such a ride drops riders from a height of feet. Students of physics may recall that the height (in feet) of the riders, seconds after freefall (and ignoring air resistance, etc.) can be accurately modeled by .  Using this formula, it is easy to verify that, without intervention, the riders will hit the ground when so at seconds. Suppose the designers of the ride decide to begin slowing the riders' fall after seconds (corresponding to a height of  86 ). How fast will the riders be traveling at that time?  We have been given a position function, but what we want to compute is a velocity at a specific point in time, , we want an instantaneous velocity . We do not currently know how to calculate this.  However, we do know from common experience how to calculate an average velocity . (If we travel miles in hours, we know we had an average velocity of 30 .) We looked at this concept in Section when we introduced the difference quotient. We have   We can approximate the instantaneous velocity at by considering the average velocity over some time period containing . If we make the time interval small, we will get a good approximation. (This fact is commonly used. For instance, high speed cameras are used to track fast moving objects. Distances are measured over a fixed number of frames to generate an accurate approximation of the velocity.)  Consider the interval from to (just before the riders hit the ground). On that interval, the average velocity is , where the minus sign indicates that the riders are moving down . By narrowing the interval we consider, we will likely get a better approximation of the instantaneous velocity. On we have .   Units in Calculations  In the above calculations, we left off the units until the end of the problem. You should always be sure that you label your answer with the correct units. For example, if gave you the cost (in $) of producing widgets, the units on the difference quotient would be $\/widget.   We can do this for smaller and smaller intervals of time. For instance, over a time span of one tenth of a second, , on , we have .  Over a time span of one hundredth of a second, on , the average velocity is .  What we are really computing is the average velocity on the interval for small values of . That is, we are computing where is small.  We really want to use , but this, of course, returns the familiar indeterminate form. So we employ a limit, as we did in Section .  We can approximate the value of this limit numerically with small values of as seen in Table . It looks as though the velocity is approaching -64 .   Approximating the instantaneous velocity with average velocities over a small time period     Average Velocity ( )                         Computing the limit directly gives .  Graphically, we can view the average velocities we computed numerically as the slopes of secant lines on the graph of going through the points and . In Figures , the secant line corresponding to is shown in three contexts. Figure shows a zoomed out version of with its secant line. In Figure , we zoom in around the points of intersection between and the secant line. Notice how well this secant line approximates between those two points it is a common practice to approximate functions with straight lines.     The function and its secant line corresponding to and          The function and a secant line corresponding to and , zoomed in near            The function with the same secant line, zoomed in further          The function with its tangent line at          As , these secant lines approach the tangent line , a line that goes through the point with the special slope of . In Figure and Figure , we zoom in around the point . We see the secant line, which approximates well, but not as well the tangent line shown in Figure .  We have just introduced a number of important concepts that we will flesh out more within this section. First, we formally define two of them.   Derivative at a Point   Let be a continuous function on an open interval and let be in . derivative at a point The derivative of at , denoted , is , provided the limit exists. If the limit exists, we say that is differentiable at ; if the limit does not exist, then is not differentiable at . If is differentiable at every point in , then is differentiable on . differentiable      Video presentation of     Tangent Line   Let be continuous on an open interval and differentiable at , for some in . The line with equation is the tangent line to the graph of at ; that is, it is the line through whose slope is the derivative of at . tangent line  derivative tangent line     Some examples will help us understand these definitions.   Finding derivatives and tangent lines   Let . Find:        The equation of the tangent line to the graph of at .         The equation of the tangent line to the graph at .       Video solution        We compute this directly using Definition . .    The tangent line at has slope and goes through the point . Thus the tangent line has equation, in point-slope form, . In slope-intercept form we have .    Again, using the definition, .    The tangent line at has slope and goes through the point . Thus the tangent line has equation .     A graph of is given in Figure along with the tangent lines at and .   A graph of and its tangent lines at and           In , we assumed that the function is continuous, but this is actually not necessary. One can in fact prove that a function has to be continuous at any point where it is differentiable. Or, in other words, a function cannot be differentiable at a point of discontinuity. This is explained in the video in .   Showing that every differentiable function is continuous    Another important line that can be created using information from the derivative is the normal line . It is perpendicular to the tangent line, hence its slope is the negative-reciprocal of the tangent line's slope.   Normal Line   Let be continuous on an open interval and differentiable at , for some in . The normal line to the graph of at is the line with equation , when . (When , the normal line is the vertical line through ; that is, .) derivative normal line  normal line      Finding equations of normal lines   Let , as in Example . Find the equations of the normal lines to the graph of at and .    In Example , we found that . Hence at , the normal line will have slope . An equation for the normal line is .  The normal line is plotted with in Figure . Note how the line looks perpendicular to . (A key word here is looks. Mathematically, we say that the normal line is perpendicular to at as the slope of the normal line is the negative-reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line. However, normal lines may not always look perpendicular.   A graph of , along with its normal line at         The aspect ratio of the picture of the graph plays a big role in this. When using graphing software, there is usually an option called Zoom Square that keeps the aspect ratio   We also found that , so the normal line to the graph of at will have slope . An equation for the normal line is .    Linear functions are easy to work with; many functions that arise in the course of solving real problems are not easy to work with. A common practice in mathematical problem solving is to approximate difficult functions with not-so-difficult functions. Lines are a common choice. It turns out that at any given point on the graph of a differentiable function , the best linear approximation to is its tangent line. That is one reason we'll spend considerable time finding tangent lines to functions.  One type of function that does not benefit from a tangent line approximation is a line; it is rather simple to recognize that the tangent line to a line is the line itself. We look at this in the following example.   Finding the derivative of a linear function   Consider . Find the equation of the tangent line to at and .    We find the slope of the tangent line by using Definition . .  We just found that . That is, we found the instantaneous rate of change of is . This is not surprising; lines are characterized by being the only functions with a constant rate of change. That rate of change is called the slope of the line. Since their rates of change are constant, their instantaneous rates of change are always the same; they are all the slope.  So given a line , the derivative at any point will be ; that is, .  It is now easy to see that the tangent line to the graph of at is just , with the same being true at .    We often desire to find the tangent line to the graph of a function without knowing the actual derivative of the function. While we will eventually be able to find derivatives of many common functions, the algebra and limit calculations on some functions are complex. Until we develop further techniques, the best we may be able to do is approximate the tangent line. We demonstrate this in the next example.   Numerical approximation of the tangent line   Approximate the equation of the tangent line to the graph of at .    In order to find the equation of the tangent line, we need a slope and a point. The point is given to us: . To compute the slope, we need the derivative. This is where we will make an approximation. Recall that for a small value of . We choose (somewhat arbitrarily) to let . Thus .  Thus our approximation of the equation of the tangent line is ; it is graphed in Figure . The graph seems to imply the approximation is rather good.   graphed with an approximation to its tangent line at           Recall from Section that , meaning for values of near , . Since the slope of the line is at , it should seem reasonable that the slope of is near at . In fact, since we approximated the value of the slope to be , we might guess the actual value is 1. We'll come back to this later.  Consider again Example . To find the derivative of at , we needed to evaluate a limit. To find the derivative of at , we needed to again evaluate a limit. We have this process:    This process describes a function ; given one input (the value of ), we return exactly one output (the value of ). The do something box is where the tedious work (taking limits) of this function occurs.  Instead of applying this function repeatedly for different values of , let us apply it just once to the variable . We then take a limit just once. The process now looks like:    The output is the derivative function , . The function will take a number as input and return the derivative of at . This calls for a definition.   Derivative Function   Let be a differentiable function on an open interval . The function is the derivative of . derivative as a function  derivative notation   Let . The following notations all represent the derivative of : .     Video presentation of     Important: The notation is one symbol; it is not the fraction . The notation, while somewhat confusing at first, was chosen with care. A fraction-looking symbol was chosen because the derivative has many fraction-like properties. Among other places, we see these properties at work when we talk about the units of the derivative, when we discuss the Chain Rule, and when we learn about integration (topics that appear in later sections and chapters).   Explaining derivative notation    Examples will help us understand this definition.   Finding the derivative of a function   Let as in Example . Find .    We apply Definition .   So . Recall earlier we found that and . Note our new computation of affirms these facts.     Finding the derivative of a function   Let . Find .    Video solution     We apply Definition . .  So . To practice using our notation, we could also state .     Finding the derivative of a function   Find the derivative of .    Video solution     Before applying Definition , note that once this is found, we can find the actual tangent line to at , whereas we settled for an approximation in Example .   We have found that when , . This should be somewhat amazing; the result of a tedious limit process on the sine function is a nice function. Then again, perhaps this is not entirely surprising. The sine function is periodic it repeats itself on regular intervals. Therefore its rate of change also repeats itself on the same regular intervals. We should have known the derivative would be periodic; we now know exactly which periodic function it is.  Thinking back to Example , we can find the slope of the tangent line to at using our derivative. We approximated the slope as ; we now know the slope is exactly  .  Using similar techniques, we can show that the derivative of is . See if you can show this yourself; if you get stuck, you can check out the video in .   Finding the derivative of       Finding the derivative of a piecewise defined function   Find the derivative of the absolute value function, .  See Figure .   The absolute value function . Notice how the slope of the lines (and hence the tangent lines) abruptly changes at .           We need to evaluate . As is piecewise-defined, we need to consider separately the limits when and when .  When : .  When , a similar computation shows that .  We need to also find the derivative at . By the definition of the derivative at a point, we have .  Since is the point where our function's definition switches from one piece to the other, we need to consider left and right-hand limits. Consider the following, where we compute the left and right hand limits side by side.          The last lines of each column tell the story: the left and right hand limits are not equal. Therefore the limit does not exist at , and is not differentiable at . So we have .  At , does not exist; there is a jump discontinuity at ; see Figure . So is differentiable everywhere except at .   A graph of the derivative of           The point of non-differentiability came where the piecewise defined function switched from one piece to the other. Our next example shows that this does not always cause trouble.   Finding the derivative of a piecewise defined function   Find the derivative of , where . See Figure .   A graph of as defined in Example           Using Example , we know that when , . It is easy to verify that when , ; consider: .  So far we have .  We still need to find . Notice at that both pieces of are , meaning we can state that .  Being more rigorous, we can again evaluate the difference quotient limit at , utilizing again left- and right-hand limits. We will begin with the left-hand limit:   . Notice we used to finally evaluate the limit.  Now we will find the right-hand limit: .  Since both the left and right hand limits are at , the limit exists and exists (and is ). Therefore we can fully write as .  See Figure for a graph of this derivative function.   A graph of in Example .           For one more example involving piecewise-defined functions, we turn to the video in .   Determining when a piecewise-defined function is differentiable    Recall we pseudo-defined a continuous function as one in which we could sketch its graph without lifting our pencil. We can give a pseudo-definition for differentiability as well: it is a continuous function that does not have any sharp corners or a vertical tangent line. One such sharp corner is shown in Figure . Even though the function in Example is piecewise-defined, the transition is smooth hence it is differentiable. Note how in the graph of in Figure it is difficult to tell when switches from one piece to the other; there is no corner.     Differentiability on Closed Intervals  When we defined the derivative at a point in Definition , we specified that the interval over which a function was defined needed to be an open interval. Open intervals are required so that we can take a limit at any point in , meaning we want to approach from both the left and right.   differentiable on a closed interval   Recall we also required open intervals in Definition when we defined what it meant for a function to be continuous. Later, we used one-sided limits to extend continuity to closed intervals. We now extend differentiability to closed intervals by again considering one-sided limits.  Our motivation is three-fold. First, we consider common sense. In Example we found that when , , and this derivative is defined for all real numbers, hence is differentiable everywhere. It seems appropriate to also conclude that is differentiable on closed intervals, like , as well. After all, is defined at both and .  Secondly, consider . The domain of is . Is differentiable on its domain specifically, is differentiable at ? (We'll consider this in the next example.)  Finally, in later sections, having the derivative defined on closed intervals will prove useful. One such place is Section where the derivative plays a role in measuring the length of a curve.  After a formal definition of differentiability on a closed interval, we explore the concept in an example.   Differentiability on a Closed Interval   Let be continuous on and differentiable on . If the one-sided limits exist, then we say is differentiable on .    For all the functions  in this text , we can determine differentiability on by considering the limits and . This is often easier to evaluate than the limit of the difference quotient.   Differentiability at an endpoint   Consider and . The domain of each function is . It can be shown that each is differentiable on ; determine the differentiability of each at .    We start by considering and take the right-hand limit of the difference quotient: .  The one-sided limit of the difference quotient does not exist at for ; therefore is differentiable on and not differentiable on .  We state (without proof) that . Note that ; this limit was easier to evaluate than the limit of the difference quotient, though it required us to already know the derivative of .   Now consider : .  As the one-sided limit exists at , we conclude is differentiable on its domain of .   A graph of and in Example       We state (without proof) that . Note that ; again, this limit is easier to evaluate than the limit of the difference quotient.  The two functions are graphed in Figure . Note how seems to go vertical as approaches 0, implying the slopes of its tangent lines are growing toward infinity. Also note how the slopes of the tangent lines to approach 0 as approaches 0.    Most calculus textbooks omit this topic and simply avoid specific cases where it could be applied. We choose in this text to not make use of the topic unless it is needed. Many theorems in later sections require a function to be differentiable on an open interval ; we could remove the word open and just use on an interval , but choose to not do so in keeping with the current mathematical tradition. Our first use of differentiability on closed intervals comes in Chapter , where we measure the lengths of curves.  This section defined the derivative; in some sense, it answers the question of What is the derivative? The next section addresses the question What does the derivative mean ?      Terms and Concepts      ?    True    False   Let be a position function. The average rate of change on is the slope of the line through the points and                ?

In your own words, explain the difference between the average rate of change and instantaneous rate of change.         In your own words, explain the difference between Definitions 2.1.7 and Definition 2.1.19.

  "body": " Interpretations of the Derivative    Section defined the derivative of a function and gave examples of how to compute it using its definition ( , using limits). The section also started with a brief motivation for this definition, that is, finding the instantaneous velocity of a falling object given its position function. Section will give us more accessible tools for computing the derivative; tools that are easier to use than repeated use of limits.  This section falls in between the What is the definition of the derivative? and How do I compute the derivative? sections. Here we are concerned with What does the derivative mean? , or perhaps, when read with the right emphasis, What is the derivative? We offer two interconnected interpretations of the derivative, hopefully explaining why we care about it and why it is worthy of study. derivative interpretation     Interpretation of the Derivative as Instantaneous Rate of Change   Section started with an example of using the position of an object (in this case, a falling amusement park rider) to find the object's velocity. This type of example is often used when introducing the derivative because we tend to readily recognize that velocity is the instantaneous rate of change in position. In general, if is a function of , then measures the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to . Put another way, the derivative answers When changes, at what rate does change? Thinking back to the amusement park ride, we asked When time changed, at what rate did the height change? and found the answer to be By feet per second.   Now imagine driving a car and looking at the speedometer, which reads  60  . Five minutes later, you wonder how far you have traveled. Certainly, lots of things could have happened in those minutes; you could have intentionally sped up significantly, you might have come to a complete stop, you might have slowed to  20  as you passed through construction. But suppose that you know, as the driver, none of these things happened. You know you maintained a fairly consistent speed over those minutes. What is a good approximation of the distance traveled?  One could argue the only good approximation, given the information provided, would be based on In this case, we assume a constant rate of  60  with a time of minutes or of an hour. Hence we would approximate the distance traveled as miles.  Referring back to the falling amusement park ride, knowing that at the velocity was ft\/s, we could reasonably approximate that second later the riders' height would have dropped by about feet. Knowing that the riders were accelerating as they fell would inform us that this is an under-approximation . If all we knew was that and , we'd know that we'd have to stop the riders quickly otherwise they would hit the ground.  In both of these cases, we are using the instantaneous rate of change to predict future values of the output.    Units of the Derivative  It is useful to recognize the units of the derivative function. If is a function of , , for some function , and is measured in feet and in seconds, then the units of are feet per second, commonly written as ft\/s. In general, if is measured in units and is measured in units , then will be measured in units per , or . Here we see the fraction-like behavior of the derivative in the notation: the units of are .   The meaning of the derivative: World Population   Let represent the world population minutes after 12:00 a.m., January 1, 2012. It is fairly accurate to say that ( ). It is also fairly accurate to state that ; that is, at midnight on January 1, 2012, the population of the world was growing by about 156 people per minute (note the units). Twenty days later (or minutes later) we could reasonably assume the population grew by about people.     The meaning of the derivative: Manufacturing   The term widget is an economic term for a generic unit of manufacturing output. Suppose a company produces widgets and knows that the market supports a price of per widget. Let give the profit, in dollars, earned by manufacturing and selling widgets. The company likely cannot make a (positive) profit making just one widget; the start-up costs will likely exceed . Mathematically, we would write this as .  What do and mean? Approximate .    The equation means that selling widgets returns a profit of . We interpret as meaning that when we are selling widgets, the profit is increasing at rate of per widget (the units are dollars per widget. ) Since we have no other information to use, our best approximation for is: .  We approximate that selling widgets returns a profit of .    The previous examples made use of an important approximation tool that we first used in our previous driving a car at  60  example at the beginning of this section. Five minutes after looking at the speedometer, our best approximation for distance traveled assumed the rate of change was constant. In Examples and we made similar approximations. We were given rate of change information which we used to approximate total change. Notationally, we would say that .  This approximation is best when is small.  Small is a relative term; when dealing with the world population, is small in comparison to years. When manufacturing widgets, widgets is small when one plans to manufacture thousands.    The Derivative and Motion  One of the most fundamental applications of the derivative is the study of motion. Let be a position function, where is time and is distance. For instance, could measure the height of a projectile or the distance an object has traveled.   Convention with  Using to represent position is a fairly common mathematical convention. It is also common to use to represent arc length.   Let measure the distance traveled, in feet, of an object after seconds of travel. Then has units feet per second, and measures the instantaneous rate of distance change with respect to time  it measures velocity . velocity   Now consider , a velocity function. That is, at time , gives the velocity of an object. The derivative of , , gives the instantaneous rate of velocity change with respect to time   acceleration . (We often think of acceleration in terms of cars: a car may go from to in seconds. This is an average acceleration, a measurement of how quickly the velocity changed.) If velocity is measured in feet per second, and time is measured in seconds, then the units of acceleration ( , the units of ) are feet per second per second, or ft\/s \/s. We often shorten this to feet per second squared, or   , but this tends to obscure the meaning of the units. acceleration   Perhaps the most well known acceleration is that of gravity. In this text, we use or . What do these numbers mean?  A constant acceleration of means that the velocity changes by each second. For instance, let measure the velocity of a ball thrown straight up into the air, where has units ft\/s and is measured in seconds. The ball will have a positive velocity while traveling upwards and a negative velocity while falling down. The acceleration is thus . If , then second later, the velocity will have decreased by ; that is, . We can continue: . Working backward, we can also figure that .  These ideas are so important we write them out as a Key Idea.   The Derivative and Motion     Let be the position function of an object. Then is the velocity function of the object.    Let be the velocity function of an object. Then is the acceleration function of the object.    derivative motion  derivative velocity  derivative acceleration      Interpretation of the Derivative as the Slope of the Tangent Line  We now consider the second interpretation of the derivative given in this section. This interpretation is not independent from the first by any means; many of the same concepts will be stressed, just from a slightly different perspective.  Given a function , the difference quotient gives a change in values divided by a change in values; , it is a measure of the rise over run, or slope, of the secant line that goes through two points on the graph of : and . As shrinks to , these two points come close together; in the limit we find , the slope of a special line called the tangent line that intersects only once near .  Lines have a constant rate of change, their slope. Nonlinear functions do not have a constant rate of change, but we can measure their instantaneous rate of change at a given value by computing . We can get an idea of how is behaving by looking at the slopes of its tangent lines. We explore this idea in the following example.   Understanding the derivative: the rate of change   Consider as shown in Figure . It is clear that at the function is growing faster than at , as it is steeper at . How much faster is it growing at compared to ?   A graph of           We can answer this exactly (and quickly) after Section , where we learn to quickly compute derivatives. For now, we will answer graphically, by considering the slopes of the respective tangent lines.   A graph of and tangent lines at and         With practice, one can fairly effectively sketch tangent lines to a curve at a particular point. In Figure , we have sketched the tangent lines to at and , along with a grid to help us measure the slopes of these lines. At , the slope is ; at , the slope is . Thus we can say not only is growing faster at than at , it is growing three times as fast .     Understanding the graph of the derivative   Consider the graph of and its derivative, , in Figure . Use these graphs to find the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of at , , and .   Graphs of and in Example           To find the appropriate slopes of tangent lines to the graph of , we need to look at the corresponding values of .   The slope of the tangent line to at is ; this looks to be about .    The slope of the tangent line to at is ; this looks to be about .    The slope of the tangent line to at is ; this looks to be about .     Using these slopes, tangent line segments to are sketched in Figure . Included on the graph of in this figure are points where , and to help better visualize the value of at those points.   Graphs of and in Example            Approximation with the derivative   Consider again the graph of and its derivative in Example . Use the tangent line to at to approximate the value of .     Figure shows the graph of along with its tangent line, zoomed in at . Notice that near , the tangent line makes an excellent approximation of . Since lines are easy to deal with, often it works well to approximate a function with its tangent line. (This is especially true when you don't actually know much about the function at hand, as we don't in this example.)   Zooming in on and its tangent line at for the function given in Examples and         While the tangent line to was drawn in Example , it was not explicitly computed. Recall that the tangent line to at is . While is not explicitly given, by the graph it looks like . Recalling that , we can compute the tangent line to be approximately . It is often useful to leave the tangent line in point-slope form.  To use the tangent line to approximate , we simply evaluate at instead of . .  We approximate .    To demonstrate the accuracy of the tangent line approximation, we now state that in Example , . We can evaluate . Had we known all along, certainly we could have just made this computation. In reality, we often only know two things:   what is, for some value of , and    what is.     For instance, we can easily observe the location of an object and its instantaneous velocity at a particular point in time. We do not have a function for the location, just an observation. This is enough to create an approximating function for .  This last example has a direct connection to our approximation method explained above after Example . We stated there that .  If we know and for some value , then computing the tangent line at is easy: . In Example , we used the tangent line to approximate a value of . Let's use the tangent line at to approximate a value of near ; , compute to approximate , assuming again that is small. Note: .  This is the exact same approximation method used above! Not only does it make intuitive sense, as explained above, it makes analytical sense, as this approximation method is simply using a tangent line to approximate a function's value.  The importance of understanding the derivative cannot be understated. When is a function of , measures the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to and gives the slope of the tangent line to at .

  "body": " Basic Differentiation Rules   The derivative is a powerful tool but is admittedly awkward given its reliance on limits. Fortunately, one thing mathematicians are good at is abstraction. For instance, instead of continually finding derivatives at a point, we abstracted and found the derivative function.  Let's practice abstraction on linear functions, . What is ? Without limits, recognize that linear functions are characterized by being functions with a constant rate of change (the slope). The derivative, , gives the instantaneous rate of change; with a linear function, this is constant, . Thus .  Let's abstract once more. Let's find the derivative of the general quadratic function, . Using the definition of the derivative, we have: .  So if , we can immediately compute .  In this section (and in some sections to follow) we will learn some of what mathematicians have already discovered about the derivatives of certain functions and how derivatives interact with arithmetic operations. We start with a theorem.   Derivatives of Common Functions      Constant Rule  derivative Constant Rule   , where is a constant.    Power Rule  derivative Power Rule  Power Rule differentiation   , where is an integer, .    Other common functions            , for .    derivative basic rules      Video explanation of (2 videos)    This theorem starts by stating an intuitive fact: constant functions have zero rate of change as they are constant . Therefore their derivative is (they change at the rate of ). The theorem then states some fairly amazing things. The states that the derivatives of Power Functions (of the form ) are very straightforward: multiply by the power, then subtract from the power. We see something incredible about the function : it is its own derivative. We also see a new connection between the sine and cosine functions.  One special case of the is when , , when . What is ? According to the , .  In words, we are asking At what rate does change with respect to ? Since  is  , we are asking At what rate does change with respect to ? The answer is: . They change at the same rate. We can also interpret the derivative as the slope of the tangent line to the function at a point . Since is a linear function with constant slope , we can say that the derivative of is .   states that the natural exponential function has a remarkable propery: it is equal to its own derivative! The video in explains why this is the case.   Determining the derivative of    Let's practice using this theorem.   Using common derivative rules to find, and use, derivatives   Let .   Find .    Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of at .    Use the tangent line to approximate .    Sketch , and the tangent line from on the same axis.       Video solution        The states that if , then .    To find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of at , we need a point and the slope. The point is . The slope is . Thus the tangent line has equation .    We can use the tangent line to approximate since is close to . We have . We can easily find the actual value: .    See Figure .      A graph of , along with its derivative and its tangent line at            Theorem gives useful information, but we will need much more. For instance, using the theorem, we can easily find the derivative of , but it does not tell how to compute the derivative of , nor . The following theorem helps with the first two of these examples (the third is answered in the next section).   Properties of the Derivative   Let and be differentiable on an open interval and let be a real number. Then:   Sum\/Difference Rule    derivative Sum\/Difference Rule  Sum\/Difference Rule of derivatives     Constant Multiple Rule   . derivative Constant Multiple Rule  Constant Multiple Rule of derivatives         Video presentation of    While we will be mainly focused on using these rules, it can also be interesting to see where they come from. Fortunately, it is not too difficult to establish these rules using the definition of the derivative. The video in shows why the sum rule is true.   Proving the sum rule     Theorem allows us to find the derivatives of a wide variety of functions. It can be used in conjunction with the to find the derivatives of any polynomial. Recall in Example that we found, using the limit definition, the derivative of . We can now find its derivative without expressly using limits: .  We were a bit pedantic here, showing every step. Normally we would do all the arithmetic and steps in our head and readily find .   Using the tangent line to approximate a function value   Let . Approximate using an appropriate tangent line.    Video solution     This problem is intentionally ambiguous; we are to approximate using an appropriate tangent line. How good of an approximation are we seeking? What does appropriate mean?  In the real world, people solving problems deal with these issues all time. One must make a judgment using whatever seems reasonable. In this example, the actual answer is , where the real problem spot is . What is ?  Since is close to , we can assume . Thus one guess is . Can we do better? Let's use a tangent line as instructed and examine the results; it seems best to find the tangent line at .  Using Theorem we find . The slope of the tangent line is thus . Also, . So the tangent line to the graph of at is . Evaluated at , our tangent line gives . Using the tangent line, our final approximation is that .  Using a calculator, we get an answer accurate to four places after the decimal: . Our initial guess was ; our tangent line approximation was more accurate, at .  The point is not  Here's a cool way to do some math without a calculator. Sure, that might be handy sometime, but your phone could probably give you the answer. Rather, the point is to say that tangent lines are a good way of approximating, and many scientists, engineers and mathematicians often face problems too hard to solve directly. So they approximate.  The graphs in Figure shows the graph of the function along with the tangent line constructed at . The graph in Figure shows the same tangent line and function. Once zoomed in, you can barely distinguish the tangent line from the function. This indicates that the tangent line is a good a approximation of the function so long as we are near the point of tangency.    A graph of along with its tangent line approximation at         A graph of along with its tangent line approximation at , zoomed in             Higher Order Derivatives    Note: The second derivative notation could be written as .  That is, we take the derivative of twice (hence ), both times with respect to (hence ).   The derivative of a function is itself a function, therefore we can take its derivative. The following definition gives a name to this concept and introduces its notation.   Higher Order Derivatives   Let be a differentiable function on . The following are defined, provided the corresponding limits exist. derivative higher order  derivative notation    The second derivative of is: .    The third derivative of is: .    The th derivative of is: .        Higher Order Derivative Caveat   Definition comes with the caveat Where the corresponding limits exist. With differentiable on , it is possible that is not differentiable on all of , and so on.    Video explanation of    In general, when finding the fourth derivative and on, we resort to the notation, not ; after a while, too many ticks is confusing.  Let's practice using this new concept.   Finding higher order derivatives   Find the first four derivatives of the following functions:         Video solution        Using the Power and Constant Multiple Rules, we have: . Continuing on, we have . Notice how all successive derivatives will also be .    We employ Theorem repeatedly. Note how we have come right back to again. (Can you quickly figure what is?)    Employing Theorem and the Constant Multiple Rule, we can see that .         Interpreting Higher Order Derivatives  What do higher order derivatives mean ? What is the practical interpretation?  derivative higher order!interpretation   Our first answer is a bit wordy, but is technically correct and beneficial to understand. That is,   The second derivative of a function is the rate of change of the rate of change of .   One way to grasp this concept is to let describe a position function. Then, as stated in Key Idea , describes the rate of position change: velocity. We now consider , which describes the rate of velocity change. Sports car enthusiasts talk of how fast a car can go from to  60  ; they are bragging about the acceleration of the car.  We started this chapter with amusement park riders free-falling with position function . It is easy to compute ft\/s and (ft\/s)\/s. We may recognize this latter constant; it is the acceleration due to gravity. In keeping with the unit notation introduced in the previous section, we say the units are feet per second per second. This is usually shortened to feet per second squared, written as ft\/s .   It can be difficult to consider the meaning of the third, and higher order, derivatives. The third derivative is the rate of change of the rate of change of the rate of change of . That is essentially meaningless to the uninitiated. In the context of our position\/velocity\/acceleration example, the third derivative is the rate of change of acceleration, commonly referred to as jerk.   Make no mistake: higher order derivatives have great importance even if their practical interpretations are hard (or impossible ) to understand. The mathematical topic of series makes extensive use of higher order derivatives.     Terms and Concepts    What is the name of the rule which states that where is an integer?

  "title": "The Product and Quotient Rules",
  "body": " The Product and Quotient Rules   Section showed that, in some ways, derivatives behave nicely. The and established that the derivative of was not complicated. We neglected computing the derivative of things like and on purpose; their derivatives are not as straightforward. (If you had to guess what their respective derivatives are, you would probably guess wrong.) For these, we need the Product and Quotient Rules, respectively, which are defined in this section. We begin with the Product Rule.   Video introduction to     Product Rule   Let and be differentiable functions on an open interval . Power Rule differentiation  derivative Product Rule Then is a differentiable function on , and .      ! While this would be simpler than the , it is wrong.   We practice using this new rule in an example, followed by an example that demonstrates why this theorem is true.   Using the Product Rule   Use the Product Rule to compute the derivative of . Evaluate the derivative at .    Video solution     To make our use of the explicit, let's set and . We easily compute\/recall that and . Employing the rule, we have .  At , we have .  We graph and its tangent line at , which has a slope of , in Figure . While this does not prove that the Product Rule is the correct way to handle derivatives of products, it helps validate its truth.   A graph of and its tangent line at           We now investigate why the is true.   Proof of Product Rule   We can use the definition of the derivative to prove Theorem .  By the limit definition, we have .  We now do something a bit unexpected; add to the numerator (so that nothing is changed) in the form of , then do some regrouping as shown.   Adding in some clever form is a common mathematical proof technique.    . We have proven the product rule as desired. (In the last step, we also relied on the fact that since is differentiable, it is also continuous, which guarantees that .)   It is often true that we can recognize that a theorem is true through its proof yet somehow doubt its applicability to real problems. In the following example, we compute the derivative of a product of functions in two ways to verify that the is indeed right.    Exploring alternate derivative methods   Let . Find two ways: first, by expanding the given product and then taking the derivative, and second, by applying the . Verify that both methods give the same answer.    Video solution     We first expand the expression for ; a little algebra shows that . It is easy to compute : .  Instead, let's apply the to the original factored form: .  The uninformed usually assume that the derivative of the product is the product of the derivatives. Thus we are tempted to say that . Obviously this is not correct.     Using the Product Rule with a product of three functions   Let . Find .    Video solution     We have a product of three functions while the only specifies how to handle a product of two functions. Our method of handling this problem is to simply group the latter two functions together, and consider . Following the , we have .  Recognize the pattern in our answer above: when applying the to a product of three functions, there are three terms added together in the final derivative. Each term contains only one derivative of one of the original functions, and each function's derivative shows up in only one term. It is straightforward to extend this pattern to finding the derivative of a product of four or more functions.  Ultimately though, we would simplify our final computation to: If you check this answer with a CAS , it may factor and give the answer:     Now that we have the hang of the product rule pattern, it's not much more difficult to move on to products of four or more functions, as the video in demonstrates.   Taking the derivative of a product of four functions    We consider one more example before discussing another derivative rule.   Using the Product Rule   Find the derivatives of the following functions.        Recalling that the derivative of is , we use the to find our answers.     Applying the : .    Using the result from above, we compute .     This seems significant; if the natural log function is an important function (it is), it seems worthwhile to know a function whose derivative is . We have found one. (We leave it to the reader to find another; a correct answer will be very similar to this one.)    We have learned how to compute the derivatives of sums, differences, and products of functions. We now learn how to find the derivative of a quotient of functions.   Quotient Rule   Let and be differentiable functions defined on an open interval , where on . derivative Quotient Rule  Quotient Rule Then is differentiable on , and .     Video presentation of    The is not hard to use, although it might be a bit tricky to remember. A useful mnemonic works as follows. Consider a fraction's numerator and denominator as HI and LO , respectively. Then , read low dee high minus high dee low, over low low. Said fast, that phrase can roll off the tongue, making it easy to memorize. The dee high and dee low parts refer to the derivatives of the numerator and denominator, respectively.  Let's practice using the Quotient Rule.   Using the Quotient Rule   Let . Find .    Video solution     Directly applying the gives: .    The allows us to fill in holes in our understanding of derivatives of the common trigonometric functions. We start with finding the derivative of the tangent function.   Using the Quotient Rule to find   Find the derivative of .    Video solution     At first, one might feel unequipped to answer this question. But recall that , so we can apply the . .  This is a beautiful result. To confirm its truth, we can find the equation of the tangent line to at . The slope is ; , along with its tangent line, is graphed in Figure .   A graph of along with its tangent line at           We include this result in the following theorem about the derivatives of the trigonometric functions. Recall we found the derivative of in Example and stated the derivative of the cosine function in Theorem . The derivatives of the cotangent, cosecant and secant functions can all be computed directly using Theorem and the .   Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions  derivative trigonometric functions               To remember the above, it may be helpful to keep in mind that the derivatives of the trigonometric functions that start with c have a minus sign in them.   Exploring alternate derivative methods   In Example the derivative of was found using the . Rewriting as , find using Theorem and verify the two answers are the same.    We found in Example that . We now find using the , considering as . .  Finding using either method returned the same result. At first, the answers looked different, but some algebra verified they are the same. In general, there is not one final form that we seek; the immediate result from the Product Rule is fine. Work to simplify your results into a form that is most readable and useful to you.    The gives other useful results, as shown in the next example.   Using the Quotient Rule to expand the Power Rule   Find the derivatives of the following functions.         , where is an integer.       Video solution     We employ the .         .       The derivative of turned out to be rather nice. It gets better. Consider: .  This is reminiscent of the : multiply by the power, then subtract from the power. We now add to our previous Power Rule, which had the restriction of .   Power Rule with Integer Exponents   Let , where is an integer. derivative Power Rule  Power Rule differentiation Then .    Taking the derivative of many functions is relatively straightforward. It is clear (with practice) what rules apply and in what order they should be applied. Other functions present multiple paths; different rules may be applied depending on how the function is treated. One of the beautiful things about calculus is that there is not the right way; each path, when applied correctly, leads to the same result, the derivative. We demonstrate this concept in an example.   Exploring alternate derivative methods   Let . Find in each of the following ways:   By applying the ,    by viewing as and applying the and , and    by simplifying first through division.   Verify that all three methods give the same result.    Video solution        Applying the gives: .    By rewriting , we can apply the and as follows: , the same result as above.    As , we can divide through by first, giving . Now apply the . , the same result as before.        Example demonstrates three methods of finding . One is hard pressed to argue for a best method as all three gave the same result without too much difficulty, although it is clear that using the required more steps. Ultimately, the important principle to take away from this is: reduce the answer to a form that seems simple and easy to interpret. In that example, we saw different expressions for , including: .  They are equal; they are all correct; only the first is simple. Work to make answers simple.  In the next section we continue to learn rules that allow us to more easily compute derivatives than using the limit definition directly. We have to memorize the derivatives of a certain set of functions, such as the derivative of is . The , , , and show us how to find the derivatives of certain combinations of these functions. The next section shows how to find the derivatives when we compose these functions together.     Terms and Concepts      ?    True    False   The Product Rule states that                ?

  "body": " The Chain Rule  We have covered almost all of the derivative rules that deal with combinations of two (or more) functions. The operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication (including by a constant) and division led to the , the , the , the and the . To complete the list of differentiation rules, we look at the last way two (or more) functions can be combined: the process of composition ( one function inside another).   Video introduction to    One example of a composition of functions is . We currently do not know how to compute this derivative. If forced to guess, one might guess , where we recognize as the derivative of and as the derivative of . However, this is not the case; . One way to see this is to examine the graph of in Figure and its tangent line at . Clearly the slope of the tangent line there is nonzero, but . So it can't be correct to say that .   A graph of and a tangent line at       In Example we'll see the correct way to compute the derivative of , which employs the new rule this section introduces, the Chain Rule .  Before we define this new rule, recall the notation for composition of functions. We write or , read as of of , to denote composing with . In shorthand, we simply write or and read it as of . Before giving the corresponding differentiation rule, we note that the rule extends to multiple compositions like or , etc.  To motivate the rule, let's look at three derivatives we can already compute.   Exploring similar derivatives   Find the derivatives of , , and . (We'll see later why we are using subscripts for different functions and an uppercase .)    In order to use the rules we already have, we must first expand each function as It is not hard to see that: An interesting fact is that these can be rewritten as:   A pattern might jump out at you; note how the we end up multiplying by the old power and the new power is reduced by 1. We also always multiply by .  Recognize that each of these functions is a composition, letting : .  We'll come back to this example after giving the formal statements of the Chain Rule; for now, we are just illustrating a pattern.     When composing functions, we need to make sure that the new function is actually defined. For instance, consider and . The domain of excludes all negative numbers, but the range of is only negative numbers. Therefore the composition is not defined for any , and hence is not differentiable.  The statement of Theorem takes care to ensure this problem does not arise, but our focus is more on the derivative result than on the domain\/range conditions.    The Chain Rule   Let be a differentiable function on an interval , let the range of be a subset of the interval , and let be a differentiable function on . derivative Chain Rule  Chain Rule Then is a differentiable function on , and .     Video presentation of    Here is the Chain Rule in words:   The derivative of the outside function, evaluated at the inside function, multiplied by the derivative of the inside function.   To help understand the Chain Rule, we return to Example .   Using the Chain Rule   Use the Chain Rule to find the derivatives of the functions , , and , as given in Example .     Example ended with the recognition that each of the given functions was actually a composition of functions. To avoid confusion, we ignore most of the subscripts here.      We found that , where and . To find , we apply the . We need to note that and .  Part of the uses . This means substitute for in the equation for . That is, . Finishing out the we have .     Let , where and . We have , so . The then states .     Finally, when , we have and . Thus and . Thus .        Example demonstrated a particular pattern: when , then . This is called the Generalized Power Rule.   Generalized Power Rule   Let be a differentiable function and let be an integer. derivative Generalized Power Rule  Generalized Power Rule Then .    This allows us to quickly find the derivative of functions like . While it may look intimidating, the Generalized Power Rule states that .  Treat the derivative-taking process step-by-step. In the example just given, first multiply by , then rewrite the inside of the parentheses, raising it all to the th power. Then think about the derivative of the expression inside the parentheses, and multiply by that.  We now consider more examples that employ the .   Using the Chain Rule   Find the derivatives of the following functions:  .  .  .      Video solution        Consider . Recognize that this is a composition of functions, where and . Thus .    Recognize that is the composition of and . Also, recall that . This leads us to: . Note that was only defined for , so the result of is only valid for as well.    Recognize that is the composition of and . Remembering that , we have .        Using the Chain Rule to find a tangent line   Let . Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of at .    The tangent line goes through the point with slope . To find , we need the .   . Evaluated at , we have . Thus the equation of the tangent line is approximated by .  The tangent line is sketched along with in Figure .   sketched along with its tangent line at           The is used often in taking derivatives. Because of this, one can become familiar with the basic process and learn patterns that facilitate finding derivatives quickly. For instance, .  A concrete example of this is .  While the derivative may look intimidating at first, look for the pattern. The denominator is the same as what was inside the natural log function; the numerator is simply its derivative.  This pattern recognition process can be applied to lots of functions. In general, instead of writing anything , we use as a generic function of . We then say .  The following is a short list of how the can be quickly applied to familiar functions.  .  .  .  .  .    Of course, the can be applied in conjunction with any of the other rules we have already learned. We practice this next.   Using the Product, Quotient and Chain Rules   Find the derivatives of the following functions.  .  .      Video solution        We must use the and . Do not think that you must be able to see the whole answer immediately; rather, just proceed step-by-step. .    We must employ the along with the . Again, proceed step-by-step. .       A key to correctly working these problems is to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces. For instance, when using the and together, just consider the first part of the at first: . Just rewrite , then find . Then move on to the part. Don't attempt to figure out both parts at once.  Likewise, using the , approach the numerator in two steps and handle the denominator after completing that. Only simplify afterward.  We can also employ the itself several times, as shown in the next example.   Using the Chain Rule multiple times   Find the derivative of .    Video solution     Recognize that we have the function inside the function; that is, we have . We begin using the ; in this first step, we do not fully compute the derivative. Rather, we are approaching this step-by-step. .  We now find . We again need the ; .  Combine this with what we found above to give .  This function is frankly a ridiculous function, possessing no real practical value. It is very difficult to graph, as the tangent function has many vertical asymptotes and grows so very fast. The important thing to learn from this is that the derivative can be found. In fact, it is not hard ; one can take several simple steps and should be careful to keep track of how to apply each of these steps.    It is a traditional mathematical exercise to find the derivatives of arbitrarily complicated functions just to demonstrate that it can be done . Just break everything down into smaller pieces.   Using the Product, Quotient and Chain Rules   Find the derivative of .    This function likely has no practical use outside of demonstrating derivative skills. The answer is given below without simplification. It employs the , the , and the three times. .  The reader is highly encouraged to look at each term and recognize why it is there. ( , the is used; in the numerator, identify the LOdHI term, etc.) This example demonstrates that derivatives can be computed systematically, no matter how arbitrarily complicated the function is.    The also has theoretic value. That is, it can be used to find the derivatives of functions that we have not yet learned as we do in the following example.   The Chain Rule and exponential functions   Use the Chain Rule to find the derivative of .    We only know how to find the derivative of one exponential function, . We can accomplish our goal by rewriting in terms of . Recalling that and are inverse functions, we can write and so , using the power to a power property of exponents.  The function is now the composition , with and . Since and , the gives .  Recall that the term on the right hand side is just , our original function. Thus, the derivative contains the original function itself. We have .  We can extend this process to use any base , where and . All we need to do is replace each 2 in our work with . The Chain Rule, coupled with the derivative rule of , allows us to find the derivatives of all exponential functions.    The comment at the end of previous example is important and is restated formally as a theorem.   Derivatives of Exponential Functions   Let , for . derivative exponential functions Then is differentiable for all real numbers ( , differentiable everywhere) and .     Derivatives of exponential and general power functions     Alternate Chain Rule Notation  It is instructive to understand what the  looks like using notation instead of notation. Suppose that is a function of , where is a function of , as stated in Theorem . Then, through the composition , we can think of as a function of , as . Thus the derivative of with respect to makes sense; we can talk about . This leads to an interesting progression of notation: Chain Rule notation derivative Chain Rule    Here the fractional aspect of the derivative notation stands out. On the right hand side, it seems as though the terms cancel out, leaving .  It is important to realize that we are not canceling these terms; the derivative notation of is one symbol. It is equally important to realize that this notation was chosen precisely because of this behavior. It makes applying the easy with multiple variables. For instance, . where and are any variables you'd like to use.  One of the most common ways of visualizing the is to consider a set of gears, as shown in Figure . The gears have , , and teeth, respectively. That means for every revolution of the gear, the gear revolves twice. That is, the rate at which the gear makes a revolution is twice as fast as the rate at which the gear makes a revolution.    Using the terminology of calculus, the rate of -change, with respect to , is .  Likewise, every revolution of causes revolutions of : . How does change with respect to ? For each revolution of , revolves times; that is, .  We can then extend the with more variables by adding more gears to the picture.    A series of gears to demonstrate the Chain Rule. Note how          It is difficult to overstate the importance of the . So often the functions that we deal with are compositions of two or more functions, requiring us to use this rule to compute derivatives. It is also often used in real life when actual functions are unknown. Through measurement, we can calculate (or, approximate) and . With our knowledge of the , we can find .  In Section , we use the to justify another differentiation technique. There are many curves that we can draw in the plane that fail the vertical line test. For instance, consider , which describes the unit circle. We may still be interested in finding slopes of tangent lines to the circle at various points. Section shows how we can find without first solving for . While we can in this instance, in many other instances solving for is impossible. In these situations, implicit differentiation is indispensable.     Terms and Concepts      ?

Using Implicit Differentiation   Find given that .    Video solution     We start by taking the derivative of both sides (thus maintaining the equality.) We have: .  The right hand side is easy; it returns .  The left hand side requires more consideration. We take the derivative term-by-term. Using the technique derived from Equation above, we can see that .  We apply the same process to the term. .  Putting this together with the right hand side, we have .  Now solve for . It's important to treat as an algebraically independent variable from and .   This equation for probably seems unusual for it contains both and terms. How is it to be used? We'll address that next.    Implicit functions are generally harder to deal with than explicit functions. With an explicit function, given an value, we have an explicit formula for computing the corresponding value. With an implicit function, one often has to find and values at the same time that satisfy the equation. It is much easier to demonstrate that a given point satisfies the equation than to actually find such a point.  For instance, we can affirm easily that the point lies on the graph of the implicit function . Plugging in for , we see the left hand side is . Setting , we see the right hand side is also ; the equation is satisfied. The following example finds the equation of the tangent line to this function at this point.   Using implicit differentiation to find a tangent line   Find the equation of the line tangent to the curve of the implicitly defined function at the point .    Video solution     In Example we found that .  We find the slope of the tangent line at the point by substituting for and for . Thus at the point , we have the slope as .  Therefore the equation of the tangent line to the implicitly defined function at the point is .  The curve and this tangent line are shown in Figure .   The function and its tangent line at the point           This suggests a general method for implicit differentiation. For the steps below assume is a function of .     Take the derivative of each term in the equation. Treat the terms like normal. When taking the derivatives of terms, the usual rules apply except that, because of the Chain Rule , we need to multiply each term by .    Get all the terms on one side of the equal sign and put the remaining terms on the other side.    Factor out ; solve for by dividing.     (Practical Note: when working by hand, it may be beneficial to use the symbol instead of , as the latter can be easily confused for or .)   Using Implicit Differentiation   Given the implicitly defined function , find .    Video solution     We will take the implicit derivatives term by term. The derivative of is .  The second term, , is a little tricky. It requires the as it is the product of two functions of : and . Its derivative is . The first part of this expression requires a because we are taking the derivative of a term. The second part does not require it because we are taking the derivative of .  The derivative of the right hand side is easily found to be . In all, we get: .  Move terms around so that the left side consists only of the terms and the right side consists of all the other terms: .  Factor out from the left side and solve to get .  To confirm the validity of our work, let's find the equation of a tangent line to this function at a point. It is easy to confirm that the point lies on the graph of this function. At this point, . So the equation of the tangent line is . The function and its tangent line are graphed in Figure .   A graph of the implicitly defined function along with its tangent line at the point         Notice how our curve looks much different than for functions we have seen. For one, it fails the vertical line test, and so the complete curve is not truly representing as a function of . But when we indicate we are interested in the derivative at , we are indicating that we want the function defined by the small portion of the curve that passes through , and that small portion does pass the vertical line test. Such functions are important in many areas of mathematics, so developing tools to deal with them is also important.     Using Implicit Differentiation   Given the implicitly defined function , find .    Video solution     Differentiating term by term, we find the most difficulty in the first term. It requires both the and . .  We leave the derivatives of the other terms to the reader. After taking the derivatives of both sides, we have .  We now have to be careful to properly solve for , particularly because of the product on the left. It is best to multiply out the product. Doing this, we get .  From here we can safely move around terms to get the following: .  Then we can solve for to get .  A graph of this implicit function is given in Figure .   A graph of the implicitly defined curve         It is easy to verify that the points , and all lie on the graph. We can find the slopes of the tangent lines at each of these points using our formula for .  At , the slope is .  At , the slope is .  At , the slope is also .  The tangent lines have been added to the graph of the function in Figure .   A graph of the implicitly defined curve and certain tangent lines           Quite a few famous curves have equations that are given implicitly. We can use implicit differentiation to find the slope at various points on those curves. We investigate two such curves in the next examples.   Finding slopes of tangent lines to a circle   Find the slope of the tangent line to the circle at the point .    Taking derivatives, we get . Solving for gives: .  This is a clever formula. Recall that the slope of the line through the origin and the point on the circle will be . We have found that the slope of the tangent line to the circle at that point is the opposite reciprocal of , namely, . Hence these two lines are always perpendicular.  At the point , we have the tangent line's slope as .  A graph of the circle and its tangent line at is given in Figure , along with a thin dashed line from the origin that is perpendicular to the tangent line. (It turns out that all normal lines to a circle pass through the center of the circle.)   The unit circle with its tangent line at           This section has shown how to find the derivatives of implicitly defined functions, whose graphs include a wide variety of interesting and unusual shapes. Implicit differentiation can also be used to further our understanding of regular differentiation.  One hole in our current understanding of derivatives is this: what is the derivative of the square root function? That is,   We allude to a possible solution, as we can write the square root function as a power function with a rational (or, fractional) power. We are then tempted to apply the and obtain .  The trouble with this is that the was initially defined only for positive integer powers, . While we did not justify this at the time, generally the is proved using something called the Binomial Theorem, which deals only with positive integers. The allowed us to extend the to negative integer powers. Implicit Differentiation allows us to extend the to rational powers, as shown below.  Let , where and are integers with no common factors (so and is fine, but and is not). We can rewrite this explicit function implicitly as . Now apply implicit differentiation. .  The above derivation is the key to the proof extending the to rational powers. Using limits, we can extend this once more to include all powers, including irrational (even transcendental!) powers, giving the following theorem.   Power Rule for Differentiation   Let , where is a real number. Then is differentiable on its domain, except possibly at , and . derivative Power Rule  Power Rule differentiation     This theorem allows us to say the derivative of is .  We now apply this final version of the in the next example, the second investigation of a famous curve.    Using the Power Rule   Find the slope of at the point .    This is a particularly interesting curve called an astroid . It is the shape traced out by a point on the edge of a circle that is rolling around inside of a larger circle, as shown in Figure .   An astroid, traced out by a point on the smaller circle as it rolls inside the larger circle         To find the slope of the astroid at the point , we take the derivative implicitly. .  Plugging in and , we get a slope of . The astroid, with its tangent line at , is shown in Figure .   An astroid with a tangent line             Implicit Differentiation and the Second Derivative  We can use implicit differentiation to find higher order derivatives. In theory, this is simple: first find , then take its derivative with respect to . In practice, it is not hard, but it often requires a bit of algebra. We demonstrate this in an example.   Finding the second derivative   Given , find .    Video solution     We found that in Example . To find , we apply implicit differentiation to . .  While this is not a particularly simple expression, it is usable. We can see that when and when . In Section , we will see how this relates to the shape of the graph.  Also, if we remember that we are only considering points on the curve , then we know that . So we can replace the in the expression for to get which is a simpler expression. Recognizing when simplifications like this are possible is not always easy.      Logarithmic Differentiation  Consider the function ; it is graphed in Figure . It is well-defined for and we might be interested in finding equations of lines tangent and normal to its graph. How do we take its derivative? logarithmic differentiation  derivative  logarithmic     In calculus the expression is also considered well-defined and equal to . This is easily confused with a limit of the form  , which is indeterminate. We skirt the issue here.    A plot of         The function is not a power function: it has a power of , not a constant. It is not an exponential function either: it has a base of , not a constant.  A differentiation technique known as logarithmic differentiation becomes useful here. The basic principle is this: take the natural log of both sides of an equation , then use implicit differentiation to find . We demonstrate this in the following example.   Using Logarithmic Differentiation   Given , use logarithmic differentiation to find .     Two approaches to solving . In the first video, taking the log of both sides. In the second, using the inverse relationship .    As suggested above, we start by taking the natural log of both sides then applying implicit differentiation. .  To test our answer, let's use it to find the equation of the tangent line at . The point on the graph our tangent line must pass through is . Using the equation for , we find the slope as .  Thus the equation of the tangent line is (approximately) . Figure graphs along with this tangent line.   A graph of and its tangent line at           We would not have been able to compute the derivative of the function in without logarithmic differentiation. But the method is also useful in cases where the product and quotient rules could be used, but logarithmic differentiation is simpler. The video in provides such an example.   Using logarithmic differentiation    Implicit differentiation proves to be useful as it allows us to find the instantaneous rates of change of a variety of functions. In particular, it extended the to rational exponents, which we then extended to all real numbers. In Section , implicit differentiation will be used to find the derivatives of inverse functions, such as .

In some cases the domain of must be restricted so that it is one-to-one. For instance, consider . Clearly, , so is not one-to-one on its regular domain, but by restricting to , is one-to-one. derivative inverse function   Now recall that one-to-one functions have inverses . That is, if is one-to-one, it has an inverse function, denoted by , such that if , then . The domain of is the range of , and vice-versa. For ease of notation, we set and treat as a function of .  Since implies , when we compose and we get a nice result: .  In general, and . This gives us a convenient way to check if two functions are inverses of each other: compose them and if the result is (on the appropriate domains), then they are inverses.   Properties of inverse functions    For a refresher on how to determine the inverse of a given function, watch the video in .   Finding the inverse of a one-to-one function    When the point lies on the graph of , the point lies on the graph of . This leads us to discover that the graph of is the reflection of across the line . In Figure we see a function graphed along with its inverse. See how the point lies on one graph, whereas lies on the other. Because of this relationship, whatever we know about can quickly be transferred into knowledge about .   A function along with its inverse . (Note how it does not matter which function we refer to as ; the other is .)         For example, consider Figure where the tangent line to at the point is drawn. That line has slope . Through reflection across , we can see that the tangent line to at the point has slope . Their slopes are reciprocals. This should make sense since reflecting a line (such as a tangent line) across the line switches the and values. Also consider the point on the graph of , where the tangent line is horizontal. At the point on , the tangent line is vertical.  More generally, consider the tangent line to at the point . That line has slope . Through reflection across , we can extend our above observation to say that the tangent line to at the point should have slope . This then tells us that .   Corresponding tangent lines drawn to and         The information from these two graphs is summarized in Table below:        Information about  Information about    lies on  lies on     Slope of tangent line to at is     Slope of tangent line to at is           We have discovered a relationship between and in a mostly graphical way. We can realize this relationship analytically as well. Let , where again . We want to find . Since , we know that . Using the and Implicit Differentiation, take the derivative of both sides of this last equality. .  This leads us to the following theorem.   Derivatives of Inverse Functions   Let be differentiable and one-to-one on an open interval , where for all in , let be the range of on , let be the inverse function of , and let for some in . Then is a differentiable function on , and in particular,             Video presentation of    The results of Theorem are not trivial; the notation may seem confusing at first. Careful consideration, along with examples, should earn understanding.  In the next example we apply Theorem to the arcsine function.  A word of caution is required here. The function is clearly not one-to-one. How can we say that is the inverse of ? To make sense of this, we employ a technique known as restriction of domain : instead of considering the entire domain of the sine function, we consider a portion of it, on which the function is one-to-one, as explained in .   Restricting the domain of     Finding the derivative of an inverse trigonometric function   Let . Find using Theorem .    Video solution     Adopting our previously defined notation, let and . Thus . Applying the theorem, we have .  This last expression is not immediately illuminating. Drawing a figure will help, as shown in Figure . Recall that the sine function can be viewed as taking in an angle and returning a ratio of sides of a right triangle, specifically, the ratio opposite over hypotenuse. This means that the arcsine function takes as input a ratio of sides and returns an angle. The equation can be rewritten as ; that is, consider a right triangle where the hypotenuse has length and the side opposite of the angle with measure has length . This means the final side has length , using the Pythagorean Theorem.   A right triangle defined by with the length of the third leg found using the Pythagorean Theorem         Therefore , resulting in .    Remember that the input of the arcsine function is a ratio of a side of a right triangle to its hypotenuse; the absolute value of this ratio will never be greater than . Therefore the inside of the square root will never be negative.  In order to make one-to-one, we restrict its domain to ; on this domain, the range is . Therefore the domain of is and the range is . When , note how the derivative of the arcsine function is undefined; this corresponds to the fact that as , the tangent lines to arcsine approach vertical lines with undefined slopes.   Graphs of and along with corresponding tangent lines              In Figure we see and graphed on their respective domains. The line tangent to at the point has slope . The slope of the corresponding point on , the point , is , verifying yet again that at corresponding points, a function and its inverse have reciprocal slopes.  Using similar techniques, we can find the derivatives of all the inverse trigonometric functions. In Table we show the restrictions of the domains of the standard trigonometric functions that allow them to be invertible.   Domains and ranges of the trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions    Function  Domain  Range                                                                  Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions   The inverse trigonometric functions are differentiable on all open sets contained in their domains (as listed in Table ) and their derivatives are as follows:         derivative inverse trig.     Note how each derivative is the negative of the derivative of its co function. Because of this, derivatives of , , and are used almost exclusively throughout this text.   Computing the derivative of    In Section , we stated without proof or explanation that . We can justify that now using Theorem , as shown in the example.   Finding the derivative of   Use Theorem to compute .    View as the inverse of . Therefore, using our standard notation, let and . We wish to find . Theorem gives: .    In this chapter we have defined the derivative, given rules to facilitate its computation, and given the derivatives of a number of standard functions. We restate the most important of these in the following theorem, intended to be a reference for further work.

  "title": "Extreme Values",
  "body": " Extreme Values  Given any quantity described by a function, we are often interested in the largest and\/or smallest values that quantity attains. For instance, if a function describes the speed of an object, it seems reasonable to want to know the fastest\/slowest the object traveled. If a function describes the value of a stock, we might want to know the highest\/lowest values the stock attained over the past year. We call such values extreme values.    Extreme Values   Let be defined on an interval containing . extreme values  absolute minimum  minimum absolute  absolute maximum  maximum absolute     is the minimum (also, absolute minimum ) of on if for all in .     is the maximum (also, absolute maximum ) of on if for all in .     The maximum and minimum values are the extreme values , or extrema , of on . extrema absolute       Note: The extreme values of a function are values, values the function attains, not the input values. However we often say there is an extreme value at certain input values. For example, has a maximum at  , and the maximum of  is  .     Video presentation of    Consider Figure . The function displayed in has a maximum, but no minimum, as the interval over which the function is defined is open. In , the function has a minimum, but no maximum; there is a discontinuity in the natural place for the maximum to occur. Finally, the function shown in has both a maximum and a minimum; note that the function is continuous and the interval on which it is defined is closed.    Graphs of functions with and without extreme values                              It is possible for discontinuous functions defined on an open interval to have both a maximum and minimum value, but we have just seen examples where they did not. On the other hand, continuous functions on a closed interval always have a maximum and minimum value.   The Extreme Value Theorem   Let be a continuous function defined on a closed interval . Then has both a maximum and minimum value on . Extreme Value Theorem      Video presentation of    This theorem states that has extreme values, but it does not offer any advice about how\/where to find these values. The process can seem to be fairly easy, as the next example illustrates. After the example, we will draw on lessons learned to form a more general and powerful method for finding extreme values.   Approximating extreme values   Consider on , as graphed in Figure . Approximate the extreme values of .   A graph of as in Example           The graph is drawn in such a way to draw attention to certain points. It certainly seems that the smallest -value is , found when . It also seems that the largest -value is , found at the endpoint of , . We use the word seems , for by the graph alone we cannot be sure the smallest value is not less than . Since the problem asks for an approximation, we approximate the extreme values to be and .    Notice how the minimum value came at the bottom of a hill, and the maximum value came at an endpoint. Also note that while is not an extreme value, it would be if we narrowed our interval to . The idea that the point is the location of an extreme value for some interval is important, leading us to a definition of a relative maximum . In short, a relative max is a -value that's the largest -value nearby.    Relative Minimum and Relative Maximum   Let be defined on an interval containing .   If there is a such that for all in where , then is a relative minimum of . We also say that has a relative minimum at . minimum relative\/local  extrema relative     If there is a such that for all in where , then is a relative maximum of . We also say that has a relative maximum at . maximum relative\/local  extrema relative      The relative maximum and minimum values comprise the relative extrema of .     Alternative Vocabulary  The terms local minimum and local maximum are often used as synonyms for relative minimum and relative maximum .  As it makes intuitive sense that an absolute maximum is also a relative maximum, Definition allows a relative maximum to occur at an interval's endpoint.    Video presentation of    We briefly practice using these definitions.   Approximating relative extrema   Consider , as shown in Figure . Approximate the relative extrema of . At each of these points, evaluate .   A graph of as in Example           We still do not have the tools to exactly find the relative extrema, but the graph does allow us to make reasonable approximations. It seems has relative minima at and , with values of and . It also seems that has a relative maximum at the point .  We approximate the relative minima to be and ; we approximate the relative maximum to be .  It is straightforward to evaluate at and . In each case, .     Approximating relative extrema   Approximate the relative extrema of , shown in Figure . At each of these points, evaluate .   A graph of as in Example           The figure implies that does not have any relative maxima, but has a relative minimum at . In fact, the graph suggests that not only is this point a relative minimum, is the minimum value of the function.  We compute . When , is undefined.    What can we learn from the previous two examples? We were able to visually approximate relative extrema, and at each such point, the derivative was either or it was not defined. This observation holds for all functions, leading to a definition and a theorem.   Critical Numbers and Critical Points   Let be defined at . The value is a critical number (or critical value ) of if or is not defined. critical number  critical point   If is a critical number of , then the point is a critical point of .     In this text we use critical number and critical value interchangeably. Other textbooks reserve the term critical value for the function value , when is a critical number.    Relative Extrema and Critical Points   Let a function be defined on an open interval containing , and let have a relative extremum at the point . Then is a critical number of .     Video presentation of and    Be careful to understand that this theorem states Relative extrema on open intervals occur at critical points. It does not say All critical numbers produce relative extrema. For instance, consider . Since , it is straightforward to determine that is a critical number of . However, has no relative extrema, as illustrated in Figure .   A graph of which has a critical value of , but no relative extrema          states that a continuous function on a closed interval will have both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. Common sense tells us extrema occur either at the endpoints or somewhere in between. It is easy to check for extrema at endpoints, but there are infinitely many points to check that are in between.  tells us we need only check at the critical points that are in between the endpoints. We combine these concepts to offer a strategy for finding extrema.   Finding Extrema on a Closed Interval  Let be a continuous function defined on a closed interval . To find the maximum and minimum values of on : extrema finding    Evaluate at the endpoints and of the interval.    Find the critical numbers of in .    Evaluate at each critical number.    The absolute maximum of is the largest of these values, and the absolute minimum of is the least of these values.      We practice these ideas in the next examples.   Finding extreme values   Find the extreme values of on , graphed in Figure .   A graph of on as in Example           Video solution     We follow the steps outlined in Key Idea . We first evaluate at the endpoints: .  Next, we find the critical values of on . ; therefore the critical values of are and . Since does not lie in the interval , we ignore it. Evaluating at the only critical number in our interval gives: .   Figure gives evaluated at the important  values in . We can easily see the maximum and minimum values of : the maximum value is and the minimum value is .   Finding the extreme values of in Example                       Note that all this was done without the aid of a graph; this work followed an analytic algorithm and did not depend on any visualization. Figure shows and we can confirm our answer, but it is important to understand that these answers can be found without graphical assistance.  We practice again.   Finding extreme values   Find the maximum and minimum values of on , where .    Video solution     Here is piecewise-defined, but we can still apply Key Idea as it is continuous on (one should check to verify that ).  Evaluating at the endpoints gives: .  We now find the critical numbers of . We have to define in a piecewise manner; it is .  Note that while is defined for all of , is not, as the derivative of does not exist when . (From the left, the derivative approaches ; from the right the derivative is .) Thus one critical number of is .  We now set . When , is never 0. When , is also never 0, so we find no critical values from setting .  So we have three important -values to consider: and . Evaluating at each gives, respectively, , and , shown in Figure . Thus the absolute minimum of is 1, the absolute maximum of is . Our answer is confirmed by the graph of in Figure .    Finding the extreme values of a piecewise-defined function in Example                      A graph of on as in Example             Finding extreme values   Find the extrema of on , graphed in Figure .    Video solution     We again use Key Idea . Evaluating at the endpoints of the interval gives: . We now find the critical values of .  Applying the , we find . Set and solve for to find the critical values of .  We have when and when . In general, when Thus when ( is always nonnegative so we ignore , etc.) So when . The only values to fall in the given interval of are and , where .  We again construct a table of important values in Figure . In this example we have five values to consider: . From the table it is clear that the maximum value of on is ; the minimum value is . The graph in Figure confirms our results.    Finding the extrema of in Example                              A graph of on as in Example            We consider one more example.   Finding extreme values   Find the extreme values of , graphed in Figure (a).    A closed interval is not given, so we find the extreme values of on its domain. is defined whenever ; thus the domain of is . Evaluating at either endpoint returns 0.    A graph of on as in Example          Finding the extrema of the half-circle in Example                      Using the , we find . The critical points of are found when or when is undefined. It is straightforward to find that when , and is undefined when , the endpoints of the interval (which are in the domain of .) The table of important values is given in Figure . The maximum value is , and the minimum value is .     Circle Revisited  We implicitly found the derivative of , the unit circle, in Section  Example as . In Example , half of the unit circle is given as .  We found . Recognize that the denominator of this fraction is ; that is, we again found .   We have seen that continuous functions on closed intervals always have a maximum and minimum value, and we have also developed a technique to find these values. In Section , we further our study of the information we can glean from nice functions with the Mean Value Theorem. On a closed interval, we can find the average rate of change of a function (as we did at the beginning of Chapter ). We will see that differentiable functions always have a point at which their instantaneous rate of change is same as the average rate of change. This is surprisingly useful, as we'll see.

  "title": "The Mean Value Theorem",
  "body": " The Mean Value Theorem  We motivate this section with the following question: Suppose you leave your house and drive to your friend's house in a city miles away, completing the trip in two hours. At any point during the trip do you necessarily have to be going miles per hour?  In answering this question, it is clear that the average speed for the entire trip is  50  (  miles in hours), but the question is whether or not your instantaneous speed is ever exactly  50  . More simply, does your speedometer ever read exactly  50  ?. The answer, under some very reasonable assumptions, is yes.    Video introduction to    Let's now see why this situation is in a calculus text by translating it into mathematical symbols.  First assume that the function gives the distance (in miles) traveled from your home at time (in hours) where . In particular, this gives and . The slope of the secant line connecting the starting and ending points and is therefore .  The slope at any point on the graph itself is given by the derivative . So, since the answer to the question above is yes, this means that at some time during the trip, the derivative takes on the value of  50  . Symbolically, for some time .  How about more generally? Given any function and a range does the value of the derivative at some point between and have to match the slope of the secant line connecting the points and ? Or equivalently, does the equation have to hold for some ?  Let's look at two functions in an example.   Comparing average and instantaneous rates of change   Consider functions with and as shown in Figure . Both functions have a value of at and . Therefore the slope of the secant line connecting the end points is in each case. But if you look at the plots of each, you can see that there are no points on either graph where the tangent lines have slope zero. Therefore we have found that there is no in such that .   Graphs of two misbehaving functions    A graph of          A graph of             So what went wrong ? It may not be surprising to find that the discontinuity of and the corner of play a role. If our functions had been continuous and differentiable, would we have been able to find that special value ? This is our motivation for the following theorem.   The Mean Value Theorem of Differentiation   Let be a continuous function on the closed interval and differentiable on the open interval . There exists a value , , such that Mean Value Theorem of differentiation derivative Mean Value Theorem  .  That is, there is a value in where the instantaneous rate of change of at is equal to the average rate of change of on .    Note that the reasons that the functions in Example fail are indeed that has a discontinuity on the interval and is not differentiable at the origin.  We will give a proof of the Mean Value Theorem below. To do so, we use a fact, called Rolle's Theorem, stated here.   Rolle's Theorem   Let be continuous on and differentiable on , where . There is some in such that . Rolle's Theorem      Video presentation of    Consider Figure where the graph of a function is given, where . It should make intuitive sense that if is differentiable (and hence, continuous) that there would be a value in where ; that is, there would be a relative maximum or minimum of in . Rolle's Theorem guarantees at least one; there may be more.   A graph of , where . Note the existence of , where , where .         Rolle's Theorem is presented here as a stepping stone toward the Mean Value Theorem, but it's a useful result in its own right. It often turns up as a tool in mathematical problem solving. The video in illustrates one such use of Rolle's Theorem.   Using Rolle's Theorem to show a polynomial has at most one real root    Rolle's Theorem is really just a special case of the Mean Value Theorem. If , then the average rate of change on is , and the theorem guarantees some where . We will prove Rolle's Theorem, then use it to prove the Mean Value Theorem.   Proof of Rolle's Theorem  Let be differentiable on where . We consider two cases.   Consider the case when is constant on ; that is, for all in . Then for all in , showing there is at least one value in where .    Now assume that is not constant on . The Extreme Value Theorem guarantees that has a maximal and minimal value on , found either at the endpoints or at a critical value in . Since and is not constant, it is clear that the maximum and minimum cannot both be found at the endpoints. Assume, without loss of generality, that the maximum of is not found at the endpoints. Therefore there is a in such that is the maximum value of . By Theorem , must be a critical number of ; since is differentiable, we have that , completing the proof of the theorem.    We can now prove the Mean Value Theorem.   Proof of the Mean Value Theorem   Define the function .  We know is differentiable on and continuous on since is. We can show (it is actually easier to show , which suffices). We can then apply Rolle's theorem to guarantee the existence of in such that . But note that ; hence , which is what we sought to prove.   Going back to the very beginning of the section, we see that the only assumption we would need about our distance function is that it be continuous and differentiable for from to hours (both reasonable assumptions). By the , we are guaranteed a time during the trip where our instantaneous speed is  50  . This fact is used in practice. Some law enforcement agencies monitor traffic speeds while in aircraft. They do not measure speed with radar, but rather by timing individual cars as they pass over lines painted on the highway whose distances apart are known. The officer is able to measure the average speed of a car between the painted lines; if that average speed is greater than the posted speed limit, the officer is assured that the driver exceeded the speed limit at some time.  Note that the is an existence theorem. It states that a special value  exists , but it does not give any indication about how to find it. It turns out that when we need the , existence is all we need.   Using the Mean Value Theorem   Consider on . Find in that satisfies the .    Video solution     The average rate of change of on is: .  We want to find such that . We find . We set this equal to and solve for .   We have found two values in where the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change; the guaranteed at least one. In Figure , is graphed with a line representing the average rate of change; the lines tangent to at are also given. Note how these lines are parallel ( , have the same slope) to the secant line.   Demonstrating the Mean Value Theorem in Example           While the has practical use (for instance, the speed monitoring application mentioned before), it is mostly used to advance other theory. We will use it in the next section to relate the shape of a graph to its derivative.  Before ending this section, we give video presentations of some of the basic theoretical applications of the Mean Value Theorem.  First, we recall that the derivative of any constant function is zero. Now, suppose that you know the derivative of some function is zero. Is the converse true? That is, are constant functions the only ones whose derivative is zero? The Mean Value Theorem says yes.   Showing that a function with zero derivative is constant    Using this result, we can establish another result which will be useful when we study antiderivatives: if two functions have the same derivative, then they differ by a constant.   Showing that two functions with the equal derivatives differ by a constant    We end this section with one more proof involving the Mean Value Theorem; this time, establishing a property of the sine function.   Demonstrating a property of the sine function      Terms and Concepts    Explain in your own words what the Mean Value Theorem states.   Answers will vary.

  "title": "Increasing and Decreasing Functions",
  "body": " Increasing and Decreasing Functions  Our study of nice functions in this chapter has so far focused on individual points: points where is maximal\/minimal, points where or does not exist, and points where is the average rate of change of on some interval.  In this section we begin to study how functions behave between special points; we begin studying in more detail the shape of their graphs.  We start with an intuitive concept. Given the graph in Figure , where would you say the function is increasing ? Decreasing ? Even though we have not defined these terms mathematically, one likely answered that is increasing when and decreasing when . We formally define these terms here.   A graph of a function used to illustrate the concepts of increasing and decreasing           Increasing and Decreasing Functions   Let be a function defined on an interval . increasing function  decreasing function       is increasing on if for every in , .     is decreasing on if for every in , .       Informally, a function is increasing if as gets larger ( , looking left to right) gets larger.   Video presentation of    Our interest lies in finding intervals in the domain of on which is either increasing or decreasing. Such information should seem useful. For instance, if describes the speed of an object, we might want to know when the speed was increasing or decreasing ( , when the object was accelerating vs. decelerating). If describes the population of a city, we should be interested in when the population is growing or declining.  To find such intervals, we again consider secant lines. Let be an increasing, differentiable function on an open interval , such as the one shown in Figure , and let be given in . The secant line on the graph of from to is drawn; it has a slope of .  But note, since and is increasing, . And these facts imply and . Therefore:   Examining the secant line of an increasing function    .          We have shown mathematically what may have already been obvious: when is increasing, its secant lines will have a positive slope. Now recall the Mean Value Theorem guarantees that there is a number , where , such that .  By considering all such secant lines in , we strongly imply that on . A similar statement can be made for decreasing functions.  Our above logic can be summarized as If is increasing, then is probably positive.  Theorem below turns this around by stating If is positive, then is increasing. This leads us to a method for finding when functions are increasing and decreasing.   Test For Increasing\/Decreasing Functions   Let be a continuous function on and differentiable on .     If for all in , then is increasing on .    If for all in , then is decreasing on .    If for all in , then is constant on .     The conclusions of and also hold if for a finite number of nonadjacent values of in .     Video presentation of    Let be differentiable on an interval and let and be in where and . If is continuous on , it follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem that there must be some value between and where . (It turns out that this is still true even if is not continuous on .) This leads us to the following method for finding intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing.   Finding Intervals on Which is Increasing or Decreasing  Let be a differentiable function on an interval . To find intervals on which is increasing and decreasing: increasing function finding intervals  decreasing function finding intervals      If not stated, find the domain of , . Begin a number line that only includes .    Find the critical values of . That is, find all in the domain of where or is not defined. (Note: Any values of  not in the domain of where is undefined should already be marked on your number line from Step ).    Use the critical values to divide into subintervals.    Pick any point in each subinterval, and find the sign of .     If , then is increasing on that subinterval.    If , then is decreasing on that subinterval.        Note that although allows us to use determine that a function is increasing or decreasing on a closed interval, it is conventional to state the intervals of increase and decrease as open intervals. We will follow this convention in the examples that follow, but it is also acceptable to answer using closed intervals.  In particular, one should note the following:   If on and on , with , then we should say that is increasing on (or on ) the zero of the derivative should be included.    If on and on , but is undefined (or is discontinuous at ), then we should not include the point in our interval. Instead, we say that is increasing on and , or on and .      We demonstrate using this process in the following example.   Finding intervals of increasing\/decreasing   Let . Find intervals on which is increasing or decreasing.    Video solution     Since an interval was not specified for us to consider, using Key Idea , the domain of is or . Next, we find the critical values of . We have , so when and when . is never undefined.  We thus break the domain (in this case the ) into three subintervals based on the two critical values we just found: , and . This is shown in Figure .   Number line for in Example       We now pick a value in each subinterval and find the sign of . All we care about is the sign, so we do not actually have to fully compute ; pick nice values that make this simple.     Subinterval 1:  We (arbitrarily) pick . We can compute directly: . We conclude that is increasing on .  Note we can arrive at the same conclusion without computation. For instance, we could choose . The first term in , , is clearly positive and very large. The other terms are small in comparison, so we know . All we need is the sign.    Subinterval 2:  We pick since that value seems easy to deal with. . We conclude is decreasing on .    Subinterval 3:  Pick an arbitrarily large value for and note that . We conclude that is increasing on .      Figure summarizes our work.   Completed number line for in Example         We can verify our calculations by considering Figure , where is graphed. The graph also presents ; note how when is increasing and when is decreasing.   A graph of in Example , showing where is increasing and decreasing           One is justified in wondering why so much work is done when the graph seems to make the intervals very clear. We give three reasons why the above work is worthwhile.  First, the points at which switches from increasing to decreasing are not precisely known given a graph. The graph shows us something significant happens near and , but we cannot determine exactly where from the graph.  One could argue that just finding critical values is important; once we know the significant points are and , the graph shows the increasing\/decreasing traits just fine. That is true. However, the technique prescribed here helps reinforce the relationship between increasing\/decreasing and the sign of . Once mastery of this concept (and several others) is obtained, one finds that either (a) just the critical points are computed and the graph shows all else that is desired, or (b) a graph is never produced, because determining increasing\/decreasing using is straightforward and the graph is unnecessary. So our second reason why the above work is worthwhile is this: once mastery of a subject is gained, one has options for finding needed information. We are working to develop mastery.  Finally, our third reason: many problems we face in the real world are very complex. Solutions are tractable only through the use of computers to do many calculations for us. Computers do not solve problems on their own, however; they need to be taught ( , programmed ) to do the right things. It would be beneficial to give a function to a computer and have it return maximum and minimum values, intervals on which the function is increasing and decreasing, the locations of relative maxima, etc. The work that we are doing here is easily programmable. It is hard to teach a computer to look at the graph and see if it is going up or down. It is easy to teach a computer to determine if a number is greater than or less than .   In Section we learned the definition of relative maxima and minima and found that they occur at critical points. We are now learning that functions can switch from increasing to decreasing (and vice-versa) at critical points. This new understanding of increasing and decreasing creates a great method of determining whether a critical point corresponds to a maximum, minimum, or neither. Imagine a function increasing until a critical point at , after which it decreases. A quick sketch helps confirm that must be a relative maximum. A similar statement can be made for relative minimums. We formalize this concept in a theorem.   First Derivative Test   Let be continuous on an interval , and differentiable on , except possibly at , where is a critical number in . First Derivative Test  derivative First Deriv. Test  extrema and First Deriv. Test  maximum and First Deriv. Test  minimum and First Deriv. Test    If the sign of switches from positive to negative at , then is a relative maximum of .    If the sign of switches from negative to positive at , then is a relative minimum of .    If is positive (or, negative) before and after , then is not a relative extrema of .        Video presentation of     Importance of Continuity  The continuity of when using the first derivative test is very important. Without continuity, almost anything can happen at a critical number. For example, we can construct a piecewise function where the sign of switches to positive to negative at and is not a local maximum. This is shown in Figure .   A discontinuous function where changes sign at 1, but is not a local maximum          Using the First Derivative Test   Find the intervals on which is increasing and decreasing, and use the First Derivative Test to determine the relative extrema of , where .    Video solution     We start by noting the domain of : .  Since is not defined at (it has a vertical asymptote), the increasing\/decreasing nature of could switch at this value. We know that will be undefined since is discontinuous at . We do not formally consider to be a critical value of , but we will use to subdivide the real number line.  Using the Quotient Rule , we find .  We need to find the critical values of ; we want to know when and when is not defined. That latter is straightforward: when the denominator of is , is undefined. That occurs when , which we've already recognized as an important value, but not a critical number.   when the numerator of is . That occurs when ; , when .  We have found that has two critical numbers, , and at something important might also happen. These three numbers divide the real number line into four subintervals: .  Pick a number from each subinterval and test the sign of at to determine whether is increasing or decreasing on that interval. Again, we do well to avoid complicated computations; notice that the denominator of is always positive so we can ignore it during our work.     Interval 1:  Choosing a very small number ( , a negative number with a large magnitude) returns in the numerator of ; that will be positive. Hence is increasing on .    Interval 2:  Choosing seems simple: . We conclude is decreasing on .    Interval 3:  Choosing seems simple: . Again, is decreasing.    Interval 4:  Choosing an very large number from this subinterval will give a positive numerator and (of course) a positive denominator. So is increasing on .     In summary, is increasing on the intervals and and is decreasing on the intervals and . Since at , the sign of switched from positive to negative, Theorem states that is a relative maximum of . At , the sign of switched from negative to positive, meaning is a relative minimum. At , is not defined, so there is no relative extremum at . As previously stated, is a vertical asymptote of .   Number line for in         This is summarized in the number line shown in Figure . Also, Figure shows a graph of , confirming our calculations. This figure also shows , again demonstrating that is increasing when and decreasing when .   A graph of in Example , showing where is increasing and decreasing           One is often tempted to think that functions always alternate increasing, decreasing, increasing, decreasing, around critical values. Our previous example demonstrated that this is not always the case. While was not technically a critical value, it was an important value we needed to consider.

In that case, , and since , this implies that , which, by means that the graph of is concave up.  Similarly, if is a decreasing function on , then the graph of will be concave down. Using , we arrive at the following theorem.    Let be a continuous function on and differentiable on .     If for all in , then is concave up on .    If for all in , then is concave down on .    If for all in , then is linear on .        As with , lets us conclude that the graph of a function is concave up (or down) on a closed interval, assuming that the function is continuous on that interval. Again, we follow the convention that when a problem asks us to give the intervals on which the graph is concave up or down, we give open intervals, even if a closed interval is technically correct.  If a function has the same concavity on adjacent intervals and , and the function is continuous at , we should combine the intervals, and state the result as . However, if is a point of discontinuity, we must omit it from our intervals.   The graph of a function is concave up when is increasing. That means as one looks at a concave up graph from left to right, the slopes of the tangent lines will be increasing. Consider Figure , where a concave up graph is shown along with some tangent lines. Notice how the tangent line on the left is steep, downward, corresponding to a lesser (large negative) value of . On the right, the tangent line is steep, upward, corresponding to a greater (large positive) value of .   A function with a concave up graph. Notice how the slopes of the tangent lines, when looking from left to right, are increasing. (The slope values pictured are and ).         If a function is decreasing and concave up, then its rate of decrease is slowing; it is leveling off. You can see this in the left side of Figure . If the function is increasing and concave up, then the rate of increase is increasing. The function is increasing at a faster and faster rate. You can see this in the right side of Figure .  Now consider a function which is concave down. We essentially repeat the above paragraphs with slight variation.  The graph of a function is concave down when is decreasing. That means as one looks at a concave down graph from left to right, the slopes of the tangent lines will be decreasing. Consider Figure , where a concave down graph is shown along with some tangent lines. Notice how the tangent line on the left is steep, upward, corresponding to a greater (large positive) value of . On the right, the tangent line is steep, downward, corresponding to a lesser (large negative) value of .   A function with a concave down graph. Notice how the slopes of the tangent lines, when looking from left to right, are decreasing.         If a function is increasing and concave down, then its rate of increase is slowing; it is leveling off. If the function is decreasing and concave down, then the rate of decrease is decreasing. The function is decreasing at a faster and faster rate.   Concavity Depravity  A mnemonic for remembering what concave up\/down means is: Concave up is like a cup; concave down is like a frown. It is admittedly terrible, but it works.   Our definition of concave up and concave down is given in terms of when the first derivative is increasing or decreasing. We can apply the results of the previous section to find intervals on which a graph is concave up or down. That is, we recognize that is increasing when , etc.   Test for Concavity   Let be twice differentiable on an interval . The graph of is concave up if on , and is concave down if on . concavity test for  concavity inflection point        Demonstrating the four ways that concavity interacts with increasing\/decreasing, along with the relationships with the first and second derivatives     , increasing; , is concave down        , decreasing; , is concave down          , decreasing; , is concave up        , increasing; , is concave up           Geometric Concavity  Geometrically speaking, a function is concave up if its graph lies above its tangent lines and below secant line segments. A function is concave down if its graph lies below its tangent lines and above secant line segments.   If knowing where a graph is concave up\/down is important, it makes sense that the places where the graph changes from one to the other is also important. This leads us to a definition.   Point of Inflection   A point of inflection is a point on the graph of at which the concavity of changes. point of inflection  inflection point      Figure shows a graph of a function with inflection points labeled.   A graph of a function with its inflection points marked. The intervals where concave up\/down are also indicated.         If the concavity of changes at a point , then is changing from increasing to decreasing (or, decreasing to increasing) at . That means that the sign of is changing from positive to negative (or, negative to positive) at . A sign change may occur when or is undefined. This leads to the following theorem.   Points of Inflection   If is a point of inflection on the graph of , then either or is not defined at .    We have identified the concepts of concavity and points of inflection. It is now time to practice using these concepts; given a function, we should be able to find its points of inflection and identify intervals on which it is concave up or down. We do so in the following examples.   Finding intervals of concave up\/down, inflection points   Let . Find the inflection points of and the intervals on which it is concave up\/down.    Video solution     We start by finding and . To find the inflection points, we use Theorem and find where or where is undefined. We find is always defined, and is only when . So the point is the only possible point of inflection.  This possible inflection point divides the real line into two intervals, and . We use a process similar to the one used in the previous section to determine increasing\/decreasing. Pick any ; so is concave down on . Pick any ; so is concave up on . Since the concavity changes at , the point is an inflection point.  The number line in Figure illustrates the process of determining concavity; Figure shows a graph of and , confirming our results. Notice how is concave down precisely when and concave up when .   A number line determining the concavity of in Example          A graph of used in Example            Finding intervals of concave up\/down, inflection points   Let . Find the inflection points of and the intervals on which it is concave up\/down.    Video solution     We need to find and . Using the Quotient Rule and simplifying, we find .  To find the possible points of inflection, we seek to find where and where is not defined. Solving reduces to solving ; we find . We find that is not defined when , for then the denominator of is . We also note that itself is not defined at , having a domain of . Since the domain of is the union of three intervals, it makes sense that the concavity of could switch across intervals. We technically cannot say that has a point of inflection at as they are not part of the domain, but we must still consider these -values to be important and will include them in our number line.  The important -values at which concavity might switch are , and , which split the number line into four intervals as shown in Figure . We determine the concavity on each. Keep in mind that all we are concerned with is the sign of on the interval.     Interval 1:  Select a number in this interval with a large magnitude (for instance, ). The denominator of will be positive. In the numerator, the factor will be positive and the factor will be negative. Thus the numerator is negative and is negative. We conclude is concave down on .    Interval 2:  For any number in this interval, the factor in the numerator will be negative, the factor in the numerator will be positive, and the factor in the denominator will be negative. Thus and is concave up on this interval.    Interval 3:  Any number in this interval will be positive and small. Thus the numerator is positive while the denominator is negative. Thus and is concave down on this interval.    Interval 4:  Choose a large value for . It is evident that , so we conclude that is concave up on .      Number line for in Example         We conclude that is concave up on and and concave down on and . There is only one point of inflection, , as is not defined at . Our work is confirmed by the graph of in Figure . Notice how is concave up whenever is positive, and concave down when is negative. The inflection in occurs where changes sign.   A graph of and in Example           Recall that relative maxima and minima of are found at critical points of ; that is, they are found when or when is undefined. Likewise, the relative maxima and minima of are found when or when is undefined; note that these are the inflection points of .  What does a relative maximum of  mean ? The derivative measures the rate of change of ; maximizing means finding where is increasing the most where has the steepest tangent line. A similar statement can be made for minimizing ; it corresponds to where has the steepest negatively-sloped tangent line.  We utilize this concept in the next example.   Understanding inflection points   The sales of a certain product over a three-year span are modeled by , where is the time in years, shown in Figure . Over the first two years, sales are decreasing. Find the point at which sales are decreasing at their greatest rate.   A graph of in Example , modeling the sale of a product over time           Video solution     We want to maximize the rate of decrease, which is to say, we want to find where has a minimum. To do this, we find where is and changes from negative to positive. We find and . Setting and solving, we get (we ignore the negative solution for since it does not lie in the domain of our function ).  Since and , we can say is a local minimum of . This is both the inflection point and the point of maximum decrease. This is the point at which things first start looking up for the company. After the inflection point, sales are still decreasing, but not decreasing quite as quickly as they had been.  A graph of and is given in Figure . When , sales are decreasing; note how at , is minimized. That is, sales are decreasing at the fastest rate at . On the interval of , is decreasing but concave up, so the decline in sales is leveling off.    A graph of in Example , along with           Not every critical point corresponds to a relative extrema; has a critical point at but no relative maximum or minimum. Likewise, just because we cannot conclude concavity changes at that point. We were careful before to use terminology possible point of inflection since we needed to check to see if the concavity changed. The canonical example of  without concavity changing is . At , but is always concave up, as shown in Figure .   A graph of . Clearly is always concave up, despite the fact that when . It this example, the possible point of inflection is not a point of inflection.           The Second Derivative Test  The first derivative of a function gave us a test to find if a critical value corresponded to a relative maximum, minimum, or neither. The second derivative gives us another way to test if a critical point is a local maximum or minimum. The following theorem officially states something that is intuitive: if a critical value occurs in a region where a function is concave up, then that critical value must correspond to a relative minimum of , etc. See Figure for a visualization of this.   Demonstrating the fact that relative maxima occur when the graph is concave down and relative minima occur when the graph is concave up          The Second Derivative Test   Let be a critical value of where is defined. derivative Second Deriv. Test  Second Derivative Test  extrema and Second Deriv. Test maximum and Second Deriv. Test minimum and First Deriv. Test    If , then has a local minimum at .    If , then has a local maximum at .        Use Wisely  The second derivative test can only be used on a function that is twice differentiable at . For functions that are not twice differentiable at , you will need to use the . If you've already determined the sign diagram for , the is usually easier to apply, and it applies in cases when does not.    Video presentation of    The Second Derivative Test relates to the in the following way. If , then the graph is concave up at a critical point and itself is growing. Since and is growing at , then it must go from negative to positive at . This means the function goes from decreasing to increasing, indicating a local minimum at .   Using the Second Derivative Test   Let . Find the critical points of and use the to label them as relative maxima or minima.    Video solution     We find and . We set and solve for to find the critical values (note that is not defined at , but neither is so this is not a critical value.) We find the critical values are . We now evaluate the second derivative at these critical numbers. Evaluating , so there is a local minimum at . Evaluating , determining a relative maximum at . These results are confirmed in Figure .   A graph of in Example . The second derivative is evaluated at each critical point. When the graph is concave up, the critical point represents a local minimum; when the graph is concave down, the critical point represents a local maximum.           We have been learning how the first and second derivatives of a function relate information about the graph of that function. We have found intervals of increasing and decreasing, intervals where the graph is concave up and down, along with the locations of relative extrema and inflection points. In Chapter we saw how limits explained asymptotic behavior. In the next section we combine all of this information to produce accurate sketches of functions.

  "title": "Curve Sketching",
  "body": " Curve Sketching  We have been learning how we can understand the behavior of a function based on its first and second derivatives. While we have been treating the properties of a function separately (increasing and decreasing, concave up and concave down, etc.), we combine them here to produce an accurate graph of the function without plotting lots of extraneous points.  Why bother? Graphing utilities are very accessible, whether on a computer, a hand-held calculator, or a smartphone. These resources are usually very fast and accurate. We will see that our method is not particularly fast it will require time (but it is not hard ). So again: why bother?  We are attempting to understand the behavior of a function based on the information given by its derivatives. While all of a function's derivatives relay information about it, it turns out that most of the behavior we care about is explained by and . Understanding the interactions between the graph of and and is important. To gain this understanding, one might argue that all that is needed is to look at lots of graphs. This is true to a point, but is somewhat similar to stating that one understands how an engine works after looking only at pictures. It is true that the basic ideas will be conveyed, but hands-on access increases understanding.   Key Idea summarizes what we have learned so far that is applicable to sketching graphs of functions and gives a framework for putting that information together. It is followed by several examples.   Curve Sketching  To produce an accurate sketch a given function , consider the following steps. curve sketching    Find the domain of . Generally, we assume that the domain is the entire real line then find restrictions, such as where a denominator is or where negatives appear under the radical.    Find the critical values of .    Find the possible points of inflection of .    Find the location of any vertical asymptotes of (usually done in conjunction with Item ).    Consider the limits and to determine the end behavior of the function.    Create a number line that includes all critical points, possible points of inflection, and locations of vertical asymptotes. For each interval created, determine whether is increasing or decreasing, concave up or down.    Evaluate at each critical point and possible point of inflection. Plot these points on a set of axes. Connect these points with curves exhibiting the proper concavity. Sketch asymptotes and and intercepts where applicable.       Curve sketching   Use Key Idea to sketch .    Video solution     We follow the steps outlined in Key Idea .   The domain of is the entire real line; there are no values for which is not defined.    Find the critical values of . We compute . Use the Quadratic Formula to find the roots of : .    Find the possible points of inflection of . Compute . We have .    There are no vertical asymptotes.    We determine the end behavior using limits as approaches . . We do not have any horizontal asymptotes.    We place the values and on a number line, as shown in Figure . We mark each subinterval as increasing or decreasing, concave up or down, using the techniques used in Sections .    Evaluate at each critical number and possible inflection point.   We plot the appropriate points on axes as shown in Figure and connect the points with straight lines (to show increasing\/decreasig behavior). In Figure we adjust these lines to demonstrate the proper concavity. In Figure we show a graph of drawn with a computer program, verifying the accuracy of our sketch.         Number line for in       Sketching in Example                                 Curve sketching   Sketch .    Video solution     We again follow the steps outlined in Key Idea .     In determining the domain, we assume it is all real numbers and look for restrictions. We find that at and , is not defined. So the domain of is .    To find the critical values of , we first find . Using the , we find . We get when , and is undefined when . Since is undefined only when is also undefined, these are not critical values. The only critical value is .    To find the possible points of inflection, we find , again employing the : . We find that is never (setting the numerator equal to and solving for , we find the only roots to this quadratic are not real numbers) and is undefined when . Thus concavity will possibly only change at and (which are not in the domain of , so these won't be inflection points).    The vertical asymptotes of are at and , the places where is undefined.    There is a horizontal asymptote of , as and .    We place the values , and on a number line as shown in Figure . We mark in each interval whether is increasing or decreasing, concave up or down. We see that has a relative maximum at ; concavity changes only at the vertical asymptotes.    Evaluate at each critical number.   In Figure , we plot the points from the number line on a set of axes and connect the points with straight lines to get a general idea of what the function looks like (these lines effectively only convey increasing\/decreasing information). In Figure , we adjust the graph with the appropriate concavity. We also show crossing the -axis at and and crossing the -axis at . Finally, Figure shows a computer generated graph of , which verifies the accuracy of our sketch.        Number line for in Example       Sketching in Example                                 Curve sketching   Sketch .    We again follow Key Idea .     We assume that the domain of is all real numbers and consider restrictions. The only restrictions could come when the denominator is , but this never occurs because the denominator is a quadratic polynomial with no real roots. Therefore the domain of is all real numbers, .    We find the critical values of by setting and solving for . We find . Since the denominator of is just the square of the denominator of , there are no values of for which is undefined.    We find the possible points of inflection by solving for (again, there are no values of for which is undefined.) We find . The cubic in the numerator does not factor very nicely. We instead approximate the roots (using a CAS ) at , and .    There are no vertical asymptotes as the denominator never equals zero.    We have a horizontal asymptote of , as .    We place the critical points and possible points on a number line as shown in Figure and mark each interval as increasing\/decreasing, concave up\/down appropriately.    Evaluate at each critical number, possible inflection point.   In Figure we plot the significant points from the number line as well as the - and -intercepts, and connect the points with straight lines to get a general impression about the graph (this graph only includes increasing\/decreasing information). In Figure , we add concavity, drawing the function so that it is smooth (since is differentiable everywhere, there should be no kinks or corners). Figure shows a computer generated graph of , affirming our results.        Number line for in Example Example       Sketching in Example                                To get some more practice with curve sketching, we include a few more video examples to illustrate the process. (The last of these could be considered archival footage : it was from a first run at using our new lightboard.)   Sketching the polynomial     Sketching the graph of the trigonometric function     Sketching the graph of    In each of our examples, we found a few significant points on the graph of that corresponded to changes in increasing\/decreasing or concavity. We connected these points with straight lines, then adjusted for concavity, and finished by showing a very accurate, computer generated graph.  Why are computer graphics so good? It is not because computers are smarter than we are. Rather, it is largely because computers are much faster at computing than we are. In general, computers graph functions much like most students do when first learning to draw graphs: they plot equally spaced points, then connect the dots using lines. By using lots of points, the connecting lines are short and the graph looks smooth.  This does a fine job of graphing in most cases (in fact, this is the method used for many graphs in this text). However, in regions where the graph is very curvy, this can generate noticeable sharp edges on the graph unless a large number of points are used. High quality computer algebra systems, such as Mathematica and Sage , use special algorithms to plot lots of points only where the graph is curvy.   In Figure , two graph of is given, generated by Sage and Mathematica . The small points represent each of the places where each CAS sampled the function. Notice how at the bends of , lots of points are used; where is relatively straight, fewer points are used. (In the Mathematica plot, many points are also used at the endpoints to ensure the end behavior is accurate.)   CAS plots of illustrating the sample points    Sage output        Mathematica output      How does Sage know where the graph is curvy ? Calculus. When we study curvature in a later chapter, we will see how the first and second derivatives of a function work together to provide a measurement of curviness.  Sage employs algorithms to determine regions of high curvature and plots extra points there.  Again, the goal of this section is not How to graph a function when there is no computer to help. Rather, the goal is Understand that the shape of the graph of a function is largely determined by understanding the behavior of the function at a few key places. In Example , we were able to accurately sketch a complicated graph using only five points and knowledge of asymptotes!  There are many applications of our understanding of derivatives beyond curve sketching. The next chapter explores some of these applications, demonstrating just a few kinds of problems that can be solved with a basic knowledge of differentiation.

  "title": "Newton's Method",
  "body": " Newton's Method  Solving equations is one of the most important things we do in mathematics, yet we are surprisingly limited in what we can solve analytically. For instance, equations as simple as or cannot be solved by algebraic methods in terms of familiar functions. Fortunately, there are methods that can give us approximate solutions to equations like these. These methods can usually give an approximation correct to as many decimal places as we like. In Section we learned about the Bisection Method. This section focuses on another technique (which generally works faster), called Newton's Method.  Newton's Method is built around tangent lines. The main idea is that if is sufficiently close to a root of , then the tangent line to the graph at will cross the -axis at a point closer to the root than .  We start Newton's Method with an initial guess about roughly where the root is. Call this . (See Figure .) Draw the tangent line to the graph at and see where it meets the -axis. Call this point . Then repeat the process draw the tangent line to the graph at and see where it meets the -axis. (See Figure .) Call this point . Repeat the process again to get , , etc. This sequence of points will often converge rather quickly to a root of .   Demonstrating the geometric concept behind Newton's Method                          We can use this geometric process to create an algebraic process. Let's look at how we found . We started with the tangent line to the graph at . The slope of this tangent line is and the equation of the line is .  This line crosses the -axis when , and the -value where it crosses is what we called . So let and replace with , giving the equation: .  Now solve for : .  Since we repeat the same geometric process to find from , we have .  In general, given an approximation , we can find the next approximation, as follows: .  We summarize this process as follows.   Newton's Method  Let be a differentiable function on an interval with a root in . To approximate the value of the root, accurate to decimal places: Newton's Method      Choose a value as an initial approximation of the root. (This is often done by looking at a graph of .)    Create successive approximations iteratively; given an approximation , compute the next approximation as .    Stop the iterations when successive approximations do not differ in the first places after the decimal point.       Newton's Method is not Infallible  The sequence of approximate values may not converge, or it may converge so slowly that one is tricked into thinking a certain approximation is better than it actually is. These issues will be discussed at the end of the section.   Let's practice Newton's Method with a concrete example.   Using Newton's Method   Approximate the real root of , accurate to the first three places after the decimal, using Newton's Method and an initial approximation of .    To begin, we compute . Then we apply the Newton's Method algorithm, outlined in Key Idea .                             We performed five iterations of Newton's Method to find a root accurate to the first three places after the decimal; our final approximation is . The exact value of the root, to six decimal places, is ; It turns out that our is accurate to more than just three decimal places.  A graph of is given in Figure . We can see from the graph that our initial approximation of was not particularly accurate; a closer guess would have been . Our choice was based on ease of initial calculation, and shows that Newton's Method can be robust enough that we do not have to make a very accurate initial approximation.   A graph of in Example         We can automate this process on a calculator that has an ANS key that returns the result of the previous calculation. Start by pressing 1 and then Enter . (We have just entered our initial guess, .) Now compute by entering the following and repeatedly press the Enter key.  ANS-(ANS^3-ANS^2-1)\/(3*ANS^2-2*ANS)    Each time we press the Enter key, we are finding the successive approximations, , , , and each one is getting closer to the root. In fact, once we get past around or so, the approximations don't appear to be changing. They actually are changing, but the change is far enough to the right of the decimal point that it doesn't show up on the calculator's display. When this happens, we can be pretty confident that we have found an accurate approximation.  Using a calculator in this manner makes the calculations simple; many iterations can be computed very quickly.   Using Newton's Method to find where functions intersect   Use Newton's Method to approximate a solution to , accurate to five places after the decimal.    Newton's Method provides a method of solving ; it is not (directly) a method for solving equations like . However, this is not a problem; we can rewrite the latter equation as and then use Newton's Method.  So we rewrite as . Written this way, we are finding a root of . We compute . Next we need a starting value, . Consider Figure , where is graphed. It seems that is pretty close to the root, so we will use that as our . (The figure also shows the graphs of and . Note how they intersect at the same value as when .)   A graph of used to find an initial approximation of its root       We now compute , , etc. The formula for is .  Apply Newton's Method again to find : .  We can continue this way, but it is really best to automate this process. On a calculator with an ANS key, we would start by entering 0.75 , then Enter , inputting our initial approximation. We then enter:  ANS - (cos(ANS)-ANS)\/(-sin(ANS)-1)    Repeatedly pressing the Enter key gives successive approximations. We quickly find: .  Our approximations and did not differ for at least the first five places after the decimal, so we could have stopped. However, using our calculator in the manner described is easy, so finding was not hard. It is interesting to see how we found an approximation, accurate to as many decimal places as our calculator displays, in just four iterations.    If you know how to program, you can translate the following pseudocode into your favorite language to perform the computation in this problem.  x = 0.75 while true oldx = x x = x - (cos(x)-x)\/(-sin(x)-1) print x if abs(x-oldx) < 0.0000000001 break  This code calculates , , etc., storing each result in the variable x . The previous approximation is stored in the variable oldx . We continue looping until the difference between two successive approximations, abs(x-oldx) , is less than some small tolerance, in this case, 0.0000000001 .   Convergence of Newton's Method  What should one use for the initial guess, ? Generally, the closer to the actual root the initial guess is, the better. However, some initial guesses should be avoided. For instance, consider Example where we sought the root to . Choosing would have been a particularly poor choice. Consider Figure , where is graphed along with its tangent line at . Since , the tangent line is horizontal and does not intersect the -axis. Graphically, we see that Newton's Method fails.   A graph of , showing why an initial approximation of with Newton's Method fails       We can also see analytically that it fails. Since and , we see that is not well defined.  This problem can also occur if, for instance, it turns out that . Adjusting the initial approximation by a very small amount will likely fix the problem.  It is also possible for Newton's Method to not converge while each successive approximation is well defined. Consider , as shown in Figure . It is clear that the root is , but let's approximate this with . Figure shows graphically the calculation of ; notice how it is farther from the root than . Figure and Figure show the calculation of and , which are even farther away; our successive approximations are getting worse. (It turns out that in this particular example, each successive approximation is twice as far from the true answer as the previous approximation.)   Newton's Method fails to find a root of , regardless of the choice of .                          There is no fix to this problem; Newton's Method simply will not work and another method must be used. (In this case the particular reason Newton's Method fails is that the tangent line is vertical at the root).  While Newton's Method does not always work, it does work most of the time, and it is generally very fast. Once the approximations get close to the root, Newton's Method can as much as double the number of correct decimal places with each successive approximation. A course in Numerical Analysis will introduce the reader to more iterative root finding methods, as well as give greater detail about the strengths and weaknesses of Newton's Method.

For instance, the circumference and radius of a circle are related by ; knowing that is  6\\pi  determines the radius must be  3  .  But what if both variables are changing with time? If we know how two variables are related and we know how one of them changes with time, can we find how the other variable changes with time?  The topic of related rates allows us to answer this question: knowing the rate at which one quantity is changing can determine the rate at which another changes. related rates    This section relies heavily on implicit differentiation, so referring back to Section may help.   We demonstrate the concepts of related rates through examples.   Understanding related rates   The radius of a circle is growing at a rate of  5  . At what rate is the circumference growing?    Video solution     The circumference and radius of a circle are related by . We are given information about how the length of changes with respect to time; that is, we are told is  5  . We want to know how the length of changes with respect to time, , we want to know .  Implicitly differentiate both sides of with respect to : .  As we know is  5  , we know .  This problem was relatively straightforward, owing to the linear relationship between radius and circumference. The video in explores what would happen if we had instead been asked for the rate at which the area is changing.   Trying to find the rate at which area is changing for the circle in      In related rates problems, we will be presented with an application problem that involves two or more variables and one or more rate. It is the job of the reader to construct the appropriate model that can be used to answer the posed question. Key Idea outlines the basic steps for solving a related rates problem.   Related Rates  Related Rates     Read the problem carefully and identify the quantities that are changing with time. (There may be many quantities that change with time, try to identify which variables are important to your goal and only focus on these quantities.)    Draw a diagram (if applicable) and assign mathematical variables to each quantity that is changing with time. (If you are given a particular value of a quantity that is also changing with time, do not include these values on your diagram. We will call these instantaneous values of the variable.)    Relate the important variables using a mathematical model. (Typical models are known formulas for area, perimeter, the Pythagorean Theorem or Trigonometric Ratios.) It may be necessary to use more than one technique (such as similar triangles) to reduce your model down to one that only involves the variables of interest.    Implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation found in Step with respect to .    Substitute in the known values of rates and known instantaneous values of the variables.    Solve for the unknown rate.    Write a full sentence conclusion.      Consider another, similar example.   Finding related rates   Water streams out of a faucet at a rate of  2  onto a flat surface at a constant rate, forming a circular puddle that is  1\/8  deep.     At what rate is the area of the puddle growing?    At what rate is the radius of the circle growing?       Video solution        We can answer this question two ways: using common sense or related rates. The common sense method states that the volume of the puddle is growing by  2  , where . Since the depth is constant at  1\/8  , the area must be growing by  16  since . This approach reveals the underlying related rates principle.  Now let's solve the problem using Key Idea . Based on the problem description, the quantities that change with time are the volume of water (the volume of the puddle), the area of the circular puddle and the radius of the circle. We don't need a diagram for this problem. The important variables for this part of the problem are the volume and area.  Let and represent the Volume and Area of the puddle. We know . Take the derivative of both sides with respect to , employing implicit differentiation. We know the change in volume, , so we substitute this value into our related rates equation: , and hence . Thus the area is growing by  16  .    We already identified the quantities that are changing in Part . The variables of interest in this problem are the radius and the volume. We need an equation that relates the volume of the circle to the radius. Since the puddle is a right circular cylinder, we will use a known volume formula, where is the volume of the puddle (in   , is the radius (in inches) and is the height ( depth) of the puddle in inches. (Notice that this formula is equivalent to .) We know that the height (depth) is a constant inch. Since this quantity does not change in the problem, we can safely substitute this value now.  Implicitly derive both sides of with respect to : We know that is  2  . So we have: Solving for , we have . Note how our answer is not a number, but rather a function of . In other words, the rate at which the radius is growing depends on how big the circle already is. If the circle is very large, adding  2  of water will not make the circle much bigger at all. If the circle is dime-sized, adding the same amount of water will make a radical change in the radius of the circle.  In some ways, our problem was (intentionally) ill-posed. We need to specify a current (instantaneous) value of the radius in order to know a rate of change. When the puddle has a radius of  10  , the radius is growing at a rate of .        Studying related rates   Radar guns measure the rate of distance change between the gun and the object it is measuring. For instance, a reading of  55  means the object is moving away from the gun at a rate of miles per hour, whereas a measurement of  -25  would mean that the object is approaching the gun at a rate of miles per hour.  If the radar gun is moving (say, attached to a police car) then radar readouts are only immediately understandable if the gun and the object are moving along the same line. If a police officer is traveling  60  and gets a readout of  15  , he knows that the car ahead of him is moving away at a rate of miles an hour, meaning the car is traveling  75  . (This straight-line principle is one reason officers park on the side of the highway and try to shoot straight back down the road. It gives the most accurate reading.)  Suppose an officer is driving due north at  30  and sees a car moving due east, as shown in Figure . Using his radar gun, he measures a reading of  20  . By using landmarks, he believes both he and the other car are about mile from the intersection of their two roads.   A sketch of a police car (at bottom) attempting to measure the speed of a car (at right) in Example       If the speed limit on the other road is  55  , is the other driver speeding?    Video solution     The important quantities that are changing are: the distance of the officer to the intersection, the distance of the car to the intersection, and the distance of the officer to the car. (There are other quantities that are changing as well such as the angles and area of the triangle, but these are not important to this problem.)  Using the diagram in Figure , let's label what we know about the situation. As both the police officer and other driver are mile from the intersection, we have , , and through the Pythagorean Theorem, . These values are instantaneous values for our variables, so we won't use them until the end of the problem. Instead, we will use the variables , , and .  We need an equation that relates , , and . The Pythagorean Theorem is a good choice: . Differentiate both sides with respect to :   We know the police officer is traveling at  30  ; that is, . The reason this rate of change is negative is that is getting smaller; the distance between the officer and the intersection is shrinking. The radar measurement is . We want to find .  We have values for everything except . Solving for this we have: . Now we substitue in our known rates and instantaneous values of our variables: .  The other driver appears to be speeding slightly.     Practicality   Example is both interesting and impractical. It highlights the difficulty in using radar in a nonlinear fashion, and explains why in real life the police officer would follow the other driver to determine their speed, and not pull out pencil and paper.  The principles here are important, though. Many automated vehicles make judgments about other moving objects based on perceived distances, radar-like measurements and the concepts of related rates.    Studying related rates   A camera is placed on a tripod  10  from the side of a road. The camera is to turn to track a car that is to drive by at  100  for a promotional video. The video's planners want to know what kind of motor the tripod should be equipped with in order to properly track the car as it passes by. Figure shows the proposed setup.   Tracking a speeding car (at left) with a rotating camera       How fast must the camera be able to turn to track the car?    Video solution     The quantities that changing are and as drawn on Figure . (The hypotenuse of the triangle is also changing, but this isn't important to the problem). We seek information about how fast the camera is to turn ; therefore, we need an equation that will relate an angle to the position of the camera and the speed and position of the car.   Figure suggests we use a trigonometric equation. Letting represent the distance the car is from the point on the road directly in front of the camera, we have .  Now take the derivative of both sides of Equation using implicit differentiation: Now we solve for :   As the car is moving at  100  , we have that is  -100  (as in the last example, since is getting smaller as the car travels, is negative). We need to convert the measurements so they use the same units (we chose   ); rewrite  -100  in terms of   : .  We want to know the fastest the camera has to turn. Common sense tells us this is when the car is directly in front of the camera ( , when ). Our mathematics bears this out. In Equation we see this is when is largest; this is when , or when . We also know that we should get an answer that is in   . Since is a dimensionless measure, it won't contribute to the units. However, radians are also dimensionless. This means we can write (or erase) the word radian without any unit consequences. (The same is not true of degrees always convert degress to radians).  With approximately  -146.7  , we have   We find that is negative; this matches our diagram in Figure for is getting smaller as the car approaches the camera.  What is the practical meaning of  -14.667  ? Recall that circular revolution goes through radians, thus  14.667  means revolutions per second. The negative sign indicates the camera is rotating in a clockwise fashion.    We introduced the derivative as a function that gives the slopes of tangent lines of functions. This chapter emphasizes using the derivative in other ways. Newton's Method uses the derivative to approximate roots of functions; this section stresses the rate of change aspect of the derivative to find a relationship between the rates of change of two related quantities.  In the next section we use Extreme Value concepts to optimize quantities.     Terms and Concepts       ?

At what rate is the area of the puddle growing?    At what rate is the radius of the circle growing?       Video solution        We can answer this question two ways: using common sense or related rates. The common sense method states that the volume of the puddle is growing by  2  , where . Since the depth is constant at  1\/8  , the area must be growing by  16  since . This approach reveals the underlying related rates principle.  Now let's solve the problem using Key Idea . Based on the problem description, the quantities that change with time are the volume of water (the volume of the puddle), the area of the circular puddle and the radius of the circle. We don't need a diagram for this problem. The important variables for this part of the problem are the volume and area.  Let and represent the Volume and Area of the puddle. We know . Take the derivative of both sides with respect to , employing implicit differentiation. We know the change in volume, , so we substitute this value into our related rates equation: , and hence . Thus the area is growing by  16  .    We already identified the quantities that are changing in Part . The variables of interest in this problem are the radius and the volume. We need an equation that relates the volume of the circle to the radius. Since the puddle is a right circular cylinder, we will use a known volume formula, where is the volume of the puddle (in   , is the radius (in inches) and is the height ( depth) of the puddle in inches. (Notice that this formula is equivalent to .) We know that the height (depth) is a constant inch. Since this quantity does not change in the problem, we can safely substitute this value now.  Implicitly derive both sides of with respect to : We know that is  2  . So we have: Solving for , we have . Note how our answer is not a number, but rather a function of . In other words, the rate at which the radius is growing depends on how big the circle already is. If the circle is very large, adding  2  of water will not make the circle much bigger at all. If the circle is dime-sized, adding the same amount of water will make a radical change in the radius of the circle.  In some ways, our problem was (intentionally) ill-posed. We need to specify a current (instantaneous) value of the radius in order to know a rate of change. When the puddle has a radius of  10  , the radius is growing at a rate of .      "

  "body": " Studying related rates   Radar guns measure the rate of distance change between the gun and the object it is measuring. For instance, a reading of  55  means the object is moving away from the gun at a rate of miles per hour, whereas a measurement of  -25  would mean that the object is approaching the gun at a rate of miles per hour.  If the radar gun is moving (say, attached to a police car) then radar readouts are only immediately understandable if the gun and the object are moving along the same line. If a police officer is traveling  60  and gets a readout of  15  , he knows that the car ahead of him is moving away at a rate of miles an hour, meaning the car is traveling  75  . (This straight-line principle is one reason officers park on the side of the highway and try to shoot straight back down the road. It gives the most accurate reading.)  Suppose an officer is driving due north at  30  and sees a car moving due east, as shown in Figure . Using his radar gun, he measures a reading of  20  . By using landmarks, he believes both he and the other car are about mile from the intersection of their two roads.

  "body": " Optimization   A simple optimization problem    In Section we learned about extreme values the largest and smallest values a function attains on an interval. We motivated our interest in such values by discussing how it made sense to want to know the highest\/lowest values of a stock, or the fastest\/slowest an object was moving. In this section we apply the concepts of extreme values to solve word problems,  , problems stated in terms of situations that require us to create the appropriate mathematical framework in which to solve the problem. optimization   We start with a classic example which is followed by a discussion of the topic of optimization.   Optimization: perimeter and area   A man has feet of fencing, a large yard, and a small dog. He wants to create a rectangular enclosure for his dog with the fencing that provides the maximal area. What dimensions provide the maximal area?    One can likely guess the correct answer that is great. We will proceed to show how calculus can provide this answer in a context that proves this answer is correct.  It helps to make a sketch of the situation. Our enclosure is sketched twice in Figure , either with treetop grass and nice fence boards or as a simple rectangle. Either way, drawing a rectangle forces us to realize that we need to know the dimensions of this rectangle so we can create an area function after all, we are trying to maximize the area.   A sketch of the enclosure in Example .             We let and denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. Clearly, .  We do not yet know how to handle functions with two variables; we need to reduce this down to a single variable. We know more about the situation: the man has feet of fencing. By knowing the perimeter of the rectangle must be , we can create another equation: .  We now have two equations and two unknowns. In the latter equation, we solve for : .  Now substitute this expression for in the area equation: .  Note we now have an equation of one variable; we can truly call the Area a function of .  This function only makes sense when , otherwise we get negative values of area. So we find the extreme values of on the interval using Key Idea .  To find the critical points, we take the derivative of and set it equal to , then solve for .   We solve to find ; this is the only critical point. We evaluate at the endpoints of our interval and at this critical point to find the extreme values; in this case, all we care about is the maximum.  Clearly and , whereas   . This is the maximum. Since we earlier found , we find that is also . Thus the dimensions of the rectangular enclosure with perimeter of  100  . with maximum area is a square, with sides of length  25  .    This example is very simplistic and a bit contrived. (After all, most people create a design then buy fencing to meet their needs, and not buy fencing and plan later.) But it models well the necessary process: create equations that describe a situation, reduce an equation to a single variable, then find the needed extreme value.   In real life, problems are much more complex. The equations are often not reducible to a single variable (hence multi-variable calculus is needed) and the equations themselves may be difficult to form. Understanding the principles here will provide a good foundation for the mathematics you will likely encounter later.  We outline here the basic process of solving these optimization problems.   Solving Optimization Problems     Understand the problem. Clearly identify what quantity is to be maximized or minimized. Make a sketch if helpful.    Create equations relevant to the context of the problem, using the information given. (One of these should describe the quantity to be optimized. We'll call this the fundamental equation. )    If the fundamental equation defines the quantity to be optimized as a function of more than one variable, reduce it to a single variable function using substitutions derived from the other equations (we'll call these constraint equations).    Identify the domain of this function, keeping in mind the context of the problem.    Find the extreme values of this function on the determined domain.    Identify the values of all relevant quantities of the problem.      We will use Key Idea in a variety of examples.   Optimization: perimeter and area   Here is another classic calculus problem: A woman has a 100 feet of fencing, a small dog, and a large yard that contains a stream (that is mostly straight). She wants to create a rectangular enclosure with maximal area that uses the stream as one side. (Apparently her dog won't swim away.) What dimensions provide the maximal area?    Video solution     We will follow the steps outlined by Key Idea .     We are maximizing area . A sketch of the region will help; Figure gives two sketches of the proposed enclosed area. A key feature of the sketches is to acknowledge that one side is not fenced.   A sketch of the enclosure in Example               We want to maximize the area; as in the example before, . This is our fundamental equation. This defines area as a function of two variables, so we need another equation to reduce it to one variable.  We again appeal to the perimeter; here the perimeter is . The perimeter is our constraint equation. Note how this is a different equation for perimeter than in Example , since one of the sides does not need to be fenced.    We now reduce the fundamental equation to a single variable using our constraint equation. In the perimeter equation, solve for : . We can now write Area as . Area is now defined as a function of one variable.    We want the area to be non-negative. Since , we want and . The latter inequality implies that , so .    We now find the extreme values. At the endpoints, the minimum is found, giving an area of .  Find the critical points. We have ; setting this equal to 0 and solving for returns . This gives an area of .    We earlier set ; thus . Thus our rectangle will have two sides of length and one side of length , with a total area of  1250  .       Keep in mind as we do these problems that we are practicing a process ; that is, we are learning to turn a situation into a system of equations. These equations allow us to write a certain quantity as a function of one variable, which we then optimize.   Optimization: minimizing cost   A power line needs to be run from a power station located on the beach to an offshore facility. Figure shows the distances between the power station to the facility.  It costs to run a power line along the land, and to run a power line under water. How much of the power line should be run along the land to minimize the overall cost? What is the minimal cost?   Running a power line from the power station to an offshore facility with minimal cost in Example         Video solution     We will follow the strategy of Key Idea implicitly, without specifically numbering steps.  There are two immediate solutions that we could consider, each of which we will reject through common sense. First, we could minimize the distance by directly connecting the two locations with a straight line. However, this requires that all the wire be laid underwater, the most costly option. Second, we could minimize the underwater length by running a wire all  5000  along the beach, directly across from the offshore facility. This has the undesired effect of having the longest distance of all, probably ensuring a non-minimal cost.  The optimal solution likely has the line being run along the ground for a while, then underwater, as the figure implies. We need to label our unknown distances the distance run along the ground and the distance run underwater. Recognizing that the underwater distance can be measured as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, we choose to label the distances as shown in Figure .   Labeling unknown distances in Example       By choosing as we did (instead of letting be the distance along the land), we make the expression under the square root simple. We now create the cost function. .  So we have . This function only makes sense on the interval . While we are fairly certain the endpoints will not give a minimal cost, we still evaluate at each to verify. . (Notice that if , the line is run the full  5000  along land and a full  1000  under water. If , the line is run the maximum distance underwater.)  We now find the critical values of . We compute as .  Recognize that this is never undefined. Setting and solving for , we have: .  Evaluating at gives a minimal cost of about . The distance the power line is laid along land is ft., and the underwater distance is ft.    In the exercises you will see a variety of situations that require you to combine problem-solving skills with calculus. Focus on the process ; learn how to form equations from situations that can be manipulated into what you need. Eschew memorizing how to do this kind of problem as opposed to that kind of problem. Learning a process will benefit one far longer than memorizing a specific technique.  Before you begin the exercises, here is one more example, presented in video form in .

One can likely guess the correct answer that is great. We will proceed to show how calculus can provide this answer in a context that proves this answer is correct.  It helps to make a sketch of the situation. Our enclosure is sketched twice in Figure , either with treetop grass and nice fence boards or as a simple rectangle. Either way, drawing a rectangle forces us to realize that we need to know the dimensions of this rectangle so we can create an area function after all, we are trying to maximize the area.

One can verify that the tangent line, evaluated at , also gives .    Of course, it is easy to compute the actual answer (by hand or with a calculator): . (Before we get too cynical and say Then why bother? , note our approximation is really good!)  So why bother?  In most real life situations, we do not know the function that describes a particular behavior. Instead, we can only take measurements of how things change measurements of the derivative.  Imagine water flowing down a winding channel. It is easy to measure the speed and direction ( , the velocity ) of water at any location. It is very hard to create a function that describes the overall flow, hence it is hard to predict where a floating object placed at the beginning of the channel will end up. However, we can approximate the path of an object using differentials. Over small intervals, the path taken by a floating object is essentially linear. Differentials allow us to approximate the true path by piecing together lots of short, linear paths. This technique is called Euler's Method, studied in introductory Differential Equations courses.   PID controllers  Another place differentials are used is in a PID controller, which stands for Proportional Integral Derivative . A PID controller uses concepts of both derivative and integral calculus to very accurately control a process (such as maintaining a stable temperature on an espresso machine).   We use differentials once more to approximate the value of a function. Even though calculators are very accessible, it is neat to see how these techniques can sometimes be used to easily compute something that looks rather hard.   Using differentials to approximate a function value   Approximate .    Video solution     We expect , yet we can do better. Let , and let . Thus . We can compute , so .  We approximate the difference between and using differentials, with : .  The approximate change in from to is , so we approximate .    Differentials are important when we discuss integration . When we study that topic, we will use notation such as quite often. While we don't discuss here what all of that notation means, note the existence of the differential . Proper handling of integrals comes with proper handling of differentials.  In light of that, we practice finding differentials in general.   Finding differentials   In each of the following, find the differential .               : As , . Thus .     : Let . We need , requiring the .  We have , so .     : Let ; we need , requiring the .  We have . Thus .       Finding the differential of is really no harder than finding the derivative of ; we just multiply  by . It is important to remember that we are not simply adding the symbol at the end.  We have seen a practical use of differentials as they offer a good method of making certain approximations. Another use is error propagation. Suppose a length is measured to be , although the actual value is (where is the error, which we hope is small). This measurement of may be used to compute some other value; we can think of this latter value as for some function . As the true length is , one really should have computed . The difference between and is the propagated error.  How close are and ? This is a difference in y values: .  We can approximate the propagated error using differentials.   Using differentials to approximate propagated error   A steel ball bearing is to be manufactured with a diameter of  2  . The manufacturing process has a tolerance of   in the diameter. Given that the density of steel is about  7.85  , estimate the propagated error in the mass of the ball bearing.    Video solution      The mass of a ball bearing is found using the equation mass = volume density. In this situation the mass function is a product of the radius of the ball bearing, hence it is . The differential of the mass is .  The radius is to be  1  ; the manufacturing tolerance in the radius is   , or   . The propagated error is approximately:   Is this error significant? It certainly depends on the application, but we can get an idea by computing the relative error . The ratio between amount of error to the total mass is , or .  We leave it to the reader to confirm this, but if the diameter of the ball was supposed to be  10  , the same manufacturing tolerance would give a propagated error in mass of   , which corresponds to a percent error of . While the amount of error is much greater ( ), the percent error is much lower.      Terms and Concepts      ?

  "body": " Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integration   Video introduction to    Given a function , a differential equation is an equation that incorporates , , and the derivatives of . For instance, a simple differential equation is: .  Solving a differential equation amounts to finding a function that satisfies the given equation. Take a moment and consider that equation; can you find a function such that ?  Can you find another?  And yet another?  Hopefully you were able to come up with at least one solution: . Finding another may have seemed impossible until one realizes that a function like also has a derivative of . Once that discovery is made, finding yet another is not difficult; the function also has a derivative of . The differential equation has many solutions. This leads us to some definitions.   Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals   Let a function be given. An antiderivative of is a function such that . antiderivative  indefinite integral  integration indefinite   The set of all antiderivatives of is the indefinite integral of  , denoted by .     Video presentation of    Make a note about our definition: we refer to an antiderivative of , as opposed to the antiderivative of , since there is always an infinite number of them. We often use upper-case letters to denote antiderivatives.  When is continuous, knowing one antiderivative of allows us to find infinitely more, simply by adding a constant. Not only does this give us more antiderivatives, it gives us all of them.   Antiderivative Forms   Let and be antiderivatives of a continuous function on an interval . Then there exists a constant such that, on , .    Given a continuous function defined on an interval and one of its antiderivatives , we know all antiderivatives of on have the form for some constant . Using Definition , we can say that .  Let's analyze this indefinite integral notation. integration notation     Antiderivative notation         Figure shows the typical notation of the indefinite integral. The integration symbol, , is in reality an elongated S, representing take the sum. We will later see how sums and antiderivatives are related.  The function we want to find an antiderivative of is called the integrand . It contains the differential of the variable we are integrating with respect to. The symbol and the differential are not bookends with a function sandwiched in between; rather, the symbol means find all antiderivatives of what follows, and the function and are multiplied together; the does not just sit there.   Another important aspect of the is that it tells us which variable we're taking the antiderivative with respect to, much like how would mean to take the derivative with respect to , while would be the derivative with respect to .  Let's practice using this notation.   Evaluating indefinite integrals   Evaluate .    Video solution     We are asked to find all functions such that . Some thought will lead us to one solution: , because .  The indefinite integral of is thus , plus a constant of integration. So: .    A commonly asked question is What happened to the ? The unenlightened response is Don't worry about it. It just goes away. A full understanding includes the following.  This process of antidifferentiation is really solving a differential question. The integral presents us with a differential, . It is asking: What is ? We found lots of solutions, all of the form .  Letting , rewrite .  This is asking: What functions have a differential of the form ? The answer is Functions of the form , where is a constant. What is ? We have lots of choices, all differing by a constant; the simplest choice is .  Understanding all of this is more important later as we try to find antiderivatives of more complicated functions. In this section, we will simply explore the rules of indefinite integration, and one can succeed for now with answering What happened to the ? with It went away.   Let's practice once more before stating integration rules.   Evaluating indefinite integrals   Evaluate .    Video solution     We seek a function whose derivative is . When taking derivatives, we can consider functions term-by-term, so we can likely do that here.  What functions have a derivative of ? Some thought will lead us to a cubic, specifically , where is a constant.  What functions have a derivative of ? Here the term is raised to the first power, so we likely seek a quadratic. Some thought should lead us to , where is a constant.  Finally, what functions have a derivative of ? Functions of the form , where is a constant.  Our answer appears to be .  We do not need three separate constants of integration; combine them as one constant, giving the final answer of .  It is easy to verify our answer; take the derivative of and see we indeed get .    This final step of verifying our answer is important both practically and theoretically. In general, taking derivatives is easier than finding antiderivatives so checking our work is easy and vital as we learn.  We also see that taking the derivative of our answer returns the function in the integrand. Thus we can say that: .  Differentiation undoes the work done by antidifferentiation.   Theorem gave a list of the derivatives of common functions we had learned at that point. We restate part of that list here to stress the relationship between derivatives and antiderivatives. This list will also be useful as a glossary of common antiderivatives as we learn.   Derivatives and Antiderivatives   Here are the Common Differentiation Rules and their Common Indefinite Integral Rule counterparts.       We highlight a few important points from Theorem .        This is the Constant Multiple Rule: Constant Multiple Rule of integration we can temporarily ignore constants when finding antiderivatives, just as we did when computing derivatives ( , is just as easy to compute as ). An example: . In the last step we can consider the constant as also being multiplied by 5, but 5 times a constant is still a constant, so we just write  .       This is the Sum\/Difference Rule: integration Sum\/Difference Rule  Sum\/Difference Rule of integration we can split integrals apart when the integrand contains terms that are added\/subtracted, as we did in Example . So: In practice we generally do not write out all these steps, but we demonstrate them here for completeness.       This is the Power Rule of indefinite integration. integration Power Rule  Power Rule integration There are two important things to keep in mind:   Notice the restriction that . This is important:  ; rather, see the last rule from the list.    We are presenting antidifferentiation as the inverse operation of differentiation. Here is a useful quote to remember:    Inverse operations do the opposite things in the opposite order.    When taking a derivative using the Power Rule, we first  multiply by the power, then second  subtract  from the power. To find the antiderivative, do the opposite things in the opposite order: first  add  to the power, then second  divide by the power.          Note that this rule uses the absolute value of . The exercises will work the reader through why this is the case; for now, know the absolute value is important and cannot be ignored.      Initial Value Problems   Introducing initial value problems    In Section we saw that the derivative of a position function gave a velocity function, and the derivative of a velocity function describes acceleration. initial value problem We can now go the other way: the antiderivative of an acceleration function gives a velocity function, . While there is just one derivative of a given function, there are infinitely many antiderivatives. Therefore we cannot ask What is the velocity of an object whose acceleration is  -32  ? , since there is more than one answer.  We can find the answer if we provide more information with the question, as done in the following example. Often the additional information comes in the form of an initial value , a value of the function that one knows beforehand.   Solving initial value problems   The acceleration due to gravity of a falling object is  -32  . At time , a falling object had a velocity of  -10  . Find the equation of the object's velocity.    Video solution     We want to know a velocity function, . We know two things:   The acceleration, , , and    the velocity at a specific time, , .     Using the first piece of information, we know that is an antiderivative of . So we begin by finding the indefinite integral of : .  Now we use the fact that to find :   Thus . We can use this equation to understand the motion of the object: when , the object had a velocity of   . Since the velocity is positive, the object was moving upward.  When did the object begin moving down? Immediately after : .  Recognize that we are able to determine quite a bit about the path of the object knowing just its acceleration and its velocity at a single point in time.     Solving initial value problems   Find , given that , and .    Video solution     We start by finding , which is an antiderivative of : .  So for the correct value of . We are given that , so: .  Using the initial value, we have found . We now find by integrating again. We will use a different integration constant since we have already defined to equal above. .  We are given that , so   Thus .    This section introduced antiderivatives and the indefinite integral. We found they are needed when finding a function given information about its derivative(s). For instance, we found a velocity function given an acceleration function.  In the next section, we will see how position and velocity are unexpectedly related by the areas of certain regions on a graph of the velocity function. Then, in Section , we will see how areas and antiderivatives are closely tied together. This connection is incredibly important, as indicated by the name of the theorem that describes it: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.     Terms and Concepts    Define the term antiderivative in your own words.

  "title": "The Definite Integral",
  "body": " The Definite Integral   Video introduction to    We start with an easy problem. An object travels in a straight line at a constant velocity of 5 for 10 seconds. How far away from its starting point is the object?  We approach this problem with the familiar equation. In this case, the distance traveled is 5   10  feet.  It is interesting to note that this solution of 50 feet can be represented graphically. Consider Figure , where the constant velocity of 5 is graphed on the axes. Shading the area under the line from to gives a rectangle with an area of 50 square units; when one considers the units of the axes, we can say this area represents 50 .    The area under a constant velocity function corresponds to distance traveled       Now consider a slightly harder situation (and not particularly realistic): an object travels in a straight line with a constant velocity of 5 for 10 seconds, then instantly reverses course at a rate of 2 for 4 seconds. (Since the object is traveling in the opposite direction when reversing course, we say the velocity is a constant -2 .) How far away from the starting point is the object what is its displacement ?  Here we use , which is   Hence the object is 42 feet from its starting location.  We can again depict this situation graphically. In Figure we have the velocities graphed as straight lines on and , respectively. The displacement of the object is   Area above the -axis Area below the -axis,   which is easy to calculate as feet.   The total displacement is the area above the -axis minus the area below the -axis       Now consider a more difficult problem.   Finding position using velocity   The velocity of an object moving straight up\/down under the acceleration of gravity is given as , where time is given in seconds and velocity is in . When , the object had a height of 0 .     What was the initial velocity of the object?    What was the maximum height of the object?    What was the height of the object at time ?       Video solution     It is straightforward to find the initial velocity; at time , The initial velocity was 48 .  To answer questions about the height of the object, we need to find the object's position function . This is an initial value problem, which we studied in the previous section. We are told the initial height is , , . We know . To find , we find the indefinite integral of : .  Since , we conclude that and .  To find the maximum height of the object, we need to find the maximum of . Recalling our work finding extreme values, we find the critical points of by setting its derivative (the velocity function) equal to and solving for : .  (Notice how we ended up just finding when the velocity was 0ft\/s!) The first derivative test shows this is a maximum, so the maximum height of the object is found at .  The height at time is now straightforward to compute: . The height is 32 after seconds.  While we have answered all three questions (using derivatives and antiderivatives), let's look at them again graphically, using the concepts of area that we explored earlier.   Figure shows a graph of on axes from to . It is again straightforward to find . How can we use the graph to find the maximum height of the object?   A graph of ; the shaded areas help determine displacement       Recall how in our previous work that the displacement of the object (in this case, its height) was found as the area under the velocity curve, as shaded in the figure. Moreover, the area between the curve and the -axis that is below the -axis counted as negative area. That is, it represents the object coming back toward its starting position. So to find the maximum distance from the starting point the maximum height we find the area under the velocity line that is above the -axis, , from to . This region is a triangle; its area is which matches our previous calculation of the maximum height.  Finally, to find the height of the object at time we calculate the total signed area (where some area is negative) under the velocity function from to . This signed area is equal to , the displacement ( , signed distance) from the starting position at to the position at time . That is,  Displacement = Area above the -axis Area below -axis.  The regions are triangles, and we find .  This also matches our previous calculation of the height at .  Notice how we answered each question in this example in two ways. Our first method was to manipulate equations using our understanding of antiderivatives and derivatives. Our second method was geometric: we answered questions looking at a graph and finding the areas of certain regions of this graph.    The above example does not prove a relationship between area under a velocity function and displacement, but it does imply a relationship exists. Section will fully establish fact that the area under a velocity function is displacement.  Given a graph of a function , we will find that there is great use in computing the area between the curve and the -axis. Because of this, we need to define some terms.   The Definite Integral, Total Signed Area   Let be defined on a closed interval . The total signed area from to under is: integration definite  definite integral  signed area  total signed area  integration notation  integration area   (area under and above the -axis on ) (area above and under the -axis on ).  The definite integral of on is the total signed area of on , denoted , where and are the bounds of integration .     Video presentation of    By our definition, the definite integral gives the signed area under . We usually drop the word signed when talking about the definite integral, and simply say the definite integral gives the area under  or, more commonly, the area under the curve.   The previous section introduced the indefinite integral, which related to antiderivatives. We have now defined the definite integral, which relates to areas under a function. The two are very much related, as we'll see when we learn the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in Section . Recall that earlier we said that the symbol was an elongated S that represented finding a sum. In the context of the definite integral, this notation makes a bit more sense, as we are adding up areas under the function .  We practice using this notation.   Evaluating definite integrals   Consider the function given in Figure .   A graph of in Example       Find:             Video solution         is the area under on the interval . This region is a triangle, so the area is .     represents the area of the triangle found under the -axis on . The area is ; since it is found under the -axis, this is negative area. Therefore .     is the total signed area under on . This is .     is the area under on . This is sketched in Figure . Again, the region is a triangle, with height 5 times that of the height of the original triangle. Thus the area is .     is the area under on the interval  . This describes a line segment, not a region; it has no width. Therefore the area is 0.      A graph of in Example . (Yes, it looks just like the graph of in Figure , just with a different -scale.)         This example illustrates some of the properties of the definite integral, given here.   Properties of the Definite Integral   Let and be defined on a closed interval that contains the values , and , and let be a constant. The following hold: integration definite!properties  definite integral properties               Video presentation of    We give a brief justification of Theorem here.     1.  As demonstrated in Example , there is no area under the curve when the region has no width; hence this definite integral is 0.   2.  This states that total area is the sum of the areas of subregions. It is easily considered when we let . We can break the interval into two subintervals, and . The total area over is the area over plus the area over . It is important to note that this still holds true even if is not true. We discuss this in the next point.   3.  This property can be viewed a merely a convention to make other properties work well. (Later we will see how this property has a justification all its own, not necessarily in support of other properties.) Suppose . The discussion from the previous point clearly justifies . However, we still claim that, as originally stated, . How do Equations and relate? Start with Equation : Property justifies changing the sign and switching the bounds of integration on the term; when this is done, Equations and are equivalent. The conclusion is this: by adopting the convention of Property (3), Property (2) holds no matter the order of , and . Again, in the next section we will see another justification for this property.    4,5.  Each of these may be non-intuitive. Property (5) states that when one scales a function by, for instance, 7, the area of the enclosed region also is scaled by a factor of 7. Both Properties (4) and (5) can be proved using geometry. The details are not complicated but are not discussed here.      Evaluating definite integrals using Theorem   Consider the graph of a function shown in Figure .   A graph of a function in Example       Answer the following:     Which value is greater: or ?    Is greater or less than 0?    Which value is greater: or ?           has a positive value (since the area is above the -axis) whereas has a negative value. Hence is bigger.     is the total signed area under between and . Since the region below the -axis looks to be larger than the region above, we conclude that the definite integral has a value less than 0.    Note how the second integral has the bounds reversed. Therefore represents a positive number, greater than the area described by the first definite integral. Hence is greater.       The area definition of the definite integral allows us to use geometry to compute the definite integral of some simple functions.   Evaluating definite integrals using geometry   Evaluate the following definite integrals: .    Video solution        It is useful to sketch the function in the integrand, as shown in Figure . We see we need to compute the areas of two regions, which we have labeled and . Both are triangles, so the area computation is straightforward: . Region lies under the -axis, hence it is counted as negative area (we can think of the triangle's height as being ), so .    Recognize that the integrand of this definite integral describes a half circle, as sketched in Figure , with radius 3. Thus the area is: .                        Understanding motion given velocity   Consider the graph of a velocity function of an object moving in a straight line, given in Figure , where the numbers in the given regions gives the area of that region. Assume that the definite integral of a velocity function gives displacement. Find the maximum speed of the object and its maximum displacement from its starting position.   A graph of a velocity in Example         Video solution     Since the graph gives velocity, finding the maximum speed is simple: it looks to be 15ft\/s.  At time , the displacement is 0; the object is at its starting position. At time , the object has moved backward 11 feet. Between times and , the object moves forward 38 feet, bringing it into a position 27 feet forward of its starting position. From to the object is moving backwards again, hence its maximum displacement is 27 feet from its starting position.    In our examples, we have either found the areas of regions that have nice geometric shapes (such as rectangles, triangles and circles) or the areas were given to us. Consider Figure , where a region below is shaded. What is its area? The function is relatively simple, yet the shape it defines has an area that is not simple to find geometrically.   What is the area below on ? The region is not a usual geometric shape.       In Section we will explore how to find the areas of such regions.    Terms and Concepts    What is total signed area ?         What is displacement ?         What is             Give a single definite integral that has the same value as .         Problems    A graph of a function is given. Using the geometry of the graph, evaluate the definite integrals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               where                                A graph of a function is given; the numbers inside the shaded regions give the area of that region. Evaluate the definite integrals using this area information.

  "body": " Riemann Sums    Video introduction to    In the previous section we defined the definite integral of a function on to be the signed area between the curve and the -axis. Some areas were simple to compute; we ended the section with a region whose area was not simple to compute. In this section we develop a technique to find such areas. Riemann Sum   A fundamental calculus technique is to first answer a given problem with an approximation, then refine that approximation to make it better, then use limits in the refining process to find the exact answer. That is what we will do here.  Consider the region given in Figure , which is the area under on . What is the signed area of this region  , what is ?   A graph of . What is the area of the shaded region?         We start by approximating. We can surround the region with a rectangle with height and width of 4 and find the area is approximately 16 square units. This is obviously an over-approximation ; we are including area in the rectangle that is not under the parabola.   Approximating area under a curve with one rectangle       We have an approximation of the area, using one rectangle. How can we refine our approximation to make it better? The key to this section is this answer: use more rectangles.   Let's use four rectangles with an equal width of 1. This partitions the interval into 4 subintervals , , , and . On each subinterval we will draw a rectangle.  There are three common ways to determine the height of these rectangles: the Left Hand Rule , the Right Hand Rule , and the Midpoint Rule . The Left Hand Rule says to evaluate the function at the left-hand endpoint of the subinterval and make the rectangle that height. In Figure , the rectangle drawn on the interval has height determined by the Left Hand Rule; it has a height of . (The rectangle is labeled LHR. ) Left Hand Rule  Right Hand Rule  Midpoint Rule    Approximating using rectangles. The heights of the rectangles are determined using different rules.         The Right Hand Rule says the opposite: on each subinterval, evaluate the function at the right endpoint and make the rectangle that height. In the figure, the rectangle drawn on is drawn using as its height; this rectangle is labeled RHR. .  The Midpoint Rule says that on each subinterval, evaluate the function at the midpoint and make the rectangle that height. The rectangle drawn on was made using the Midpoint Rule, with a height of . That rectangle is labeled MPR.   These are the three most common rules for determining the heights of approximating rectangles, but one is not forced to use one of these three methods. The rectangle on has a height of approximately , very close to the Midpoint Rule. It was chosen so that the area of the rectangle is exactly the area of the region under on . (Later you'll be able to figure how to do this, too.)  The following example will approximate the value of using these rules.   Using the Left Hand, Right Hand and Midpoint Rules   Approximate the value of using the Left Hand Rule, the Right Hand Rule, and the Midpoint Rule, using 4 equally spaced subintervals.    Video solution     We break the interval into four subintervals as before. In Figure we see 4 rectangles drawn on using the Left Hand Rule. (The areas of the rectangles are given in each figure.)  Note how in the first subinterval, , the rectangle has height . We add up the areas of each rectangle (height width) for our Left Hand Rule approximation: .   Figure shows 4 rectangles drawn under using the Right Hand Rule; note how the subinterval has a rectangle of height 0.  In this example, these rectangles seem to be the mirror image of those found in Figure . This is because of the symmetry of our shaded region. Our approximation gives the same answer as before, though calculated a different way: .   Figure shows 4 rectangles drawn under using the Midpoint Rule.  This gives an approximation of as: .  Our three methods provide two approximations of : 10 and 11.   Approximating in Example    using the Left Hand Rule          using the Right Hand Rule          using the Midpoint Rule               Summation Notation  It is hard to tell at this moment which is a better approximation: 10 or 11? We can continue to refine our approximation by using more rectangles. The notation can become unwieldy, though, as we add up longer and longer lists of numbers. We introduce summation notation to ameliorate this problem. summation notation    Explaining summation notation    Suppose we wish to add up a list of numbers , , , , . Instead of writing , we use summation notation and write . The upper case sigma, represents the term sum . The index (counter) of summation in this example is ; any symbol can be used. By convention, the index takes on only the integer values between (and including) the lower and upper bounds. To the right of , the expression is called the summand. It tells us what we are summing. This is summarized in Equation .   Let's practice using this notation.   Using summation notation   Let the numbers be defined as for integers , where . So , , , etc. (The output is the positive odd integers). Evaluate the following summations:         Video solution         .    Note the starting value is different than 1: .     .       It might seem odd to stress a new, concise way of writing summations only to write each term out as we add them up. It is. The following theorem gives some of the properties of summations that allow us to work with them without writing individual terms. Examples will follow.   Properties of Summations    summation properties     , where is a constant.              Video presentation of     Evaluating summations using Theorem   Revisit Example and, using Theorem , evaluate .       We obtained the same answer without writing out all six terms. When dealing with small sizes of , it may be faster to write the terms out by hand. However, Theorem is incredibly important when dealing with large sums as we'll soon see.      Riemann Sums  Consider again . We will approximate this definite integral using 16 equally spaced subintervals and the Right Hand Rule in Example . Before doing so, it will pay to do some careful preparation. Riemann Sum    Dividing into 16 equally spaced subintervals        Figure shows a number line of divided, or partitioned , into 16 equally spaced subintervals. We denote as ; we have marked the values of , , and . We could mark them all, but the figure would get crowded. While it is easy to figure that , in general, we want a method of determining the value of without consulting the figure. Consider:      So .  If we had partitioned into 100 equally spaced subintervals, each subinterval would have length . We could compute as .  (That was far faster than creating a sketch first.)  Given any subdivision of , the first subinterval is ; the second is ; the th subinterval is .  When using the Left Hand Rule, the height of the th rectangle will be .  When using the Right Hand Rule, the height of the th rectangle will be .  When using the Midpoint Rule, the height of the th rectangle will be .  Thus approximating with 16 equally spaced subintervals can be expressed as follows, where :     Left Hand Rule       Right Hand Rule       Midpoint Rule       Left Hand Rule  Right Hand Rule  Midpoint Rule   We use these formulas in the next two examples. The following example lets us practice using the Right Hand Rule and the summation formulas introduced in Theorem .   Approximating definite integrals using sums   Approximate using the Right Hand Rule and summation formulas with 16 and 1000 equally spaced intervals.    Video solution     Using the formula derived before, using 16 equally spaced intervals and the Right Hand Rule, we can approximate the definite integral as .  We have . Since , we have .  Using the summation formulas, consider:   We were able to sum up the areas of 16 rectangles with very little computation. In Figure the function and the 16 rectangles are graphed. While some rectangles over-approximate the area, other under-approximate the area (by about the same amount). Thus our approximate area of 10.625 is likely a fairly good approximation.  Notice Equation ; by replacing 16 by 1,000 (and appropriately changing the value of ), we can use that equation to sum up 1000 rectangles!   Approximating with the Right Hand Rule and 16 evenly spaced subintervals         We do so here, skipping from the original summand to the equivalent of Equation to save space. Note that .   Using many, many rectangles, we have a likely good approximation of . That is, .    Before the above example, we stated what the summations for the Left Hand, Right Hand and Midpoint Rules looked like. Each had the same basic structure, which was:     each rectangle has the same width, which we referred to as , and    each rectangle's height is determined by evaluating at a particular point in each subinterval. For instance, the Left Hand Rule states that each rectangle's height is determined by evaluating at the left hand endpoint of the subinterval the rectangle lives on.     One could partition an interval with subintervals that do not have the same size. We refer to the length of the th subinterval as . Also, one could determine each rectangle's height by evaluating at any point in the th subinterval. Thus the height of the th subinterval would be , and the area of the th rectangle would be . These ideas are formally defined below.   Partition   A partition  of a closed interval is a set of numbers , ,  where .  The length of the th subinterval, , is . If is partitioned into subintervals of equal length, we let represent the length of each subinterval.  The size of the partition , denoted , is the length of the largest subinterval of the partition. partition  partition size of      Video presentation of    Summations of rectangles with area are named after mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, as given in the following definition.   Riemann Sum   Let be defined on a closed interval , let be a partition of as given in Definition , Riemann Sum and let denote any value in the th subinterval.  The sum is a Riemann sum of on .     Video presentation of     Figure shows the approximating rectangles of a Riemann sum of . While the rectangles in this example do not approximate well the shaded area, they demonstrate that the subinterval widths may vary and the heights of the rectangles can be determined without following a particular rule.   An example of a general Riemann sum to approximate          Usually Riemann sums are calculated using one of the three methods we have introduced. The uniformity of construction makes computations easier. Before working another example, let's summarize some of what we have learned in a convenient way.   Riemann Sum Concepts  Consider .     When the subintervals have equal length, .    The th term of an equally spaced partition is . (Thus and .)    The Left Hand Rule summation is: .    The Right Hand Rule summation is: .    The Midpoint Rule summation is: .      Let's do another example.   Approximating definite integrals with sums   Approximate using the Midpoint Rule and 10 equally spaced intervals.    Video solution     Following Key Idea , we have .  As we are using the Midpoint Rule, we will also need and . Since , . This gives .  We now construct the Riemann sum and compute its value using summation formulas.    Approximating using the Midpoint Rule and 10 evenly spaced subintervals in Example         Note the graph of in Figure . The regions whose area is computed by the definite integral are triangles, meaning we can find the exact answer without summation techniques. We find that the exact answer is indeed 22.5. One of the strengths of the Midpoint Rule is that often each rectangle includes area that should not be counted, but misses other area that should. When the partition size is small, these two amounts are about equal and these errors almost cancel each other out. In this example, since our function is a line, these errors are exactly equal and they do cancel each other out, giving us the exact answer.  Note too that when the function is negative, the rectangles have a negative height. When we compute the area of the rectangle, we use ; when is negative, the area is counted as negative.    Notice in the previous example that while we used 10 equally spaced intervals, the number 10 didn't play a big role in the calculations until the very end. Mathematicians love to abstract ideas; let's approximate the area of another region using subintervals, where we do not specify a value of until the very end.   Approximating definite integrals with a formula, using sums   Revisit yet again. Approximate this definite integral using the Right Hand Rule with equally spaced subintervals.    Video solution     Using Key Idea , we know . We also find .  We construct the Right Hand Rule Riemann sum as follows. Be sure to follow each step carefully. If you get stuck, and do not understand how one line proceeds to the next, you may skip to the result and consider how this result is used. You should come back, though, and work through each step for full understanding.   The result is an amazing, easy to use formula. To approximate the definite integral with 10 equally spaced subintervals and the Right Hand Rule, set and compute .  Recall how earlier we approximated the definite integral with 4 subintervals; with , the formula gives 10, our answer as before.  It is now easy to approximate the integral with 1,000,000 subintervals! Hand-held calculators will round off the answer a bit prematurely giving an answer of . (The actual answer is .)  We now take an important leap. Up to this point, our mathematics has been limited to geometry and algebra (finding areas and manipulating expressions). Now we apply calculus . For any finite  , we know that .  Both common sense and high-level mathematics tell us that as gets large, the approximation gets better. In fact, if we take the limit as , we get the exact area described by . That is,   This is a fantastic result. By considering equally-spaced subintervals, we obtained a formula for an approximation of the definite integral that involved our variable . As grows large without bound the error shrinks to zero and we obtain the exact area.    This section started with a fundamental calculus technique: make an approximation, refine the approximation to make it better, then use limits in the refining process to get an exact answer. That is precisely what we just did.  Let's practice this again.   Approximating definite integrals with a formula, using sums   Find a formula that approximates using the Right Hand Rule and equally spaced subintervals, then take the limit as to find the exact area.    Video solution     Following Key Idea , we have . We have , which is the right endpoint of the th subinterval.  The Riemann sum corresponding to the Right Hand Rule is (followed by simplifications):   Once again, we have found a compact formula for approximating the definite integral with equally spaced subintervals and the Right Hand Rule. Using 10 subintervals, we have an approximation of (these rectangles are shown in Figure ). Using gives an approximation of .   Approximating using the Right Hand Rule and 10 evenly spaced subintervals         Now find the exact answer using a limit: .      Limits of Riemann Sums  We have used limits to evaluate given definite integrals. Will this always work? It can be shown, given not-very-restrictive conditions, that yes, it will always work this is the content of below.   The previous two examples demonstrated how an expression such as can be rewritten as an expression explicitly involving , such as .  Viewed in this manner, we can think of the summation as a function of . An value is given (where is a positive integer), and the sum of areas of equally spaced rectangles is returned, using the Left Hand, Right Hand, or Midpoint Rules.  Given a definite integral , let:      , the sum of equally spaced rectangles formed using the Left Hand Rule,     , the sum of equally spaced rectangles formed using the Right Hand Rule, and     , the sum of equally spaced rectangles formed using the Midpoint Rule.     Recall the definition of a limit as : if, given any , there exists such that .  The following theorem states that we can use any of our three rules to find the exact value of a definite integral . It also goes two steps further. The theorem states that the height of each rectangle doesn't have to be determined following a specific rule, but could be , where is any point in the th subinterval, as discussed before Riemann Sums were defined in Definition .  The theorem goes on to state that the rectangles do not need to be of the same width. Using the notation of Definition , let denote the length of the th subinterval in a partition of and let represent the length of the largest subinterval in the partition: that is, is the largest of all the . If is small, then must be partitioned into many subintervals, since all subintervals must have small lengths. Taking the limit as goes to zero implies that the number of subintervals in the partition is growing to infinity, as the largest subinterval length is becoming arbitrarily small. We then interpret the expression as the limit of the sum of the areas of rectangles, where the width of each rectangle can be different but getting small, and the height of each rectangle is not necessarily determined by a particular rule. The theorem states that this Riemann Sum also gives the value of the definite integral of over .   One of the things tells us is that if is continuous on , then the definite integral is guaranteed to exist.  Knowing that every continuous function can be integrated is useful, since most of the functions we work with are continuous. However, it turns out that a function can be integrated even if it has a finite number of discontinuities, as long as these are removable or jump discontinuities.    Definite Integrals and the Limit of Riemann Sums   Let be continuous on the closed interval and let , , , , and be defined as before. Then: Riemann Sum and definite integral  integration definite!Riemann Sums             Video presentation of    We summarize what we have learned over the past few sections here.     Knowing the area under the curve can be useful. One common example: the area under a velocity curve is displacement.    We have defined the definite integral, , to be the signed area under on the interval .    While we can approximate a definite integral many ways, we have focused on using rectangles whose heights can be determined using the Left Hand Rule, the Right Hand Rule and the Midpoint Rule.    Sums of rectangles of this type are called Riemann sums.    The exact value of the definite integral can be computed using the limit of a Riemann sum. We generally use one of the above methods as it makes the algebra simpler.     We first learned of derivatives through limits then learned rules that made the process simpler. We know of a way to evaluate a definite integral using limits; in the next section we will see how the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus makes the process simpler. The key feature of this theorem is its connection between the indefinite integral and the definite integral.     Terms and Concepts    A fundamental calculus technique is to use to refine approximations to get an exact answer.               What is the upper bound in the summation               This section approximates definite integrals using what geometric shape?                 ?    True    False   A sum using the Right Hand Rule is an example of a Riemann Sum.              Problems    Write out each term of the summation and compute the sum.                                                                                                                                                              Write the sum in summation notation.

Use this fact, along with other parts of Theorem , to evaluate the summation.                                                              In the following exercises, a definite integral is given.

One of the strengths of the Midpoint Rule is that often each rectangle includes area that should not be counted, but misses other area that should. When the partition size is small, these two amounts are about equal and these errors almost cancel each other out. In this example, since our function is a line, these errors are exactly equal and they do cancel each other out, giving us the exact answer.

We can turn this concept into a function by letting the upper (or lower) bound vary.  Let . It computes the area under on as illustrated in Figure . We can study this function using our knowledge of the definite integral. For instance, since .   The area of the shaded region is        Exploring the Area so far function   Consider pictured in Figure Figure and its associated area so far function, . Using the graph of and geometry, find an explicit formula for .   The area of the shaded region is         Video solution     We can see from Figure that for , the area under the curve can be found by subtracting the area of two triangles. The larger triangle will have a base of and a height of , while the smaller triangle will have a base of and a height of . Therefore, the area under the curve for is given by .   The area of the shaded region is       Note that this same formula holds for . If , then . The areas to the left of will have opposite signs (since they areas are accumulated before  ). For example, when , . This is the same value we get from evaluating for . Also notice that . This integral is clearly since the areas over and will sum to zero. Again, this is the same answer obtained by evaluating for .  Therefore, we can reasonably say that . A plot of both and are given in Figure Figure . You should notice a familiar relationship between these two functions. This relationship is formally stated in .   Graphs of and           Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Parts 1 and 2  As Example hinted, we can apply calculus ideas to ; in particular, we can compute its derivative. In Example , , so . While this may seem like an innocuous thing to do, it has far-reaching implications, as demonstrated by the fact that the result is given as an important theorem.

Video solution     Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have . That is, the derivative of the area so far function, is simply the integrand replacing with .  This simple example reveals something incredible: is an antiderivative of ! Therefore, for some value of . (We can find , but generally we do not care. We know that , which allows us to compute . In this case, .)    What we have done in Example was more than finding a complicated way of computing an antiderivative. Consider a function defined on an open interval containing , and . Suppose we want to compute . First, let . Using the properties of the definite integral found in Theorem , we know Using Equation , let in the first integral and in the second integral so that and . Therefore: .  We now see how indefinite integrals and definite integrals are related: we can evaluate a definite integral using antiderivatives! In fact, this is exactly what we noticed in Example . The area so far function was indeed an anti-derivative of the integrand. This is the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2   Let be continuous on and let be any antiderivative of . Then Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  integration Fun. Thm. of Calc.  .     Video presentation of    As its name suggests, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an important result. In fact, it's sufficiently important that it's worth taking a moment to understand why it's true. A proof is given in .   Proving the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus     Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2   We spent a great deal of time in the previous section studying . Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, evaluate this definite integral.    We need an antiderivative of . All antiderivatives of have the form ; for simplicity, choose .  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states .  This is the same answer we obtained using limits in the previous section, just with much less work.     Notation:  integration notation A special notation is often used in the process of evaluating definite integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Instead of explicitly writing , the notation is used. Thus the solution to Example would be written as: .   The Constant :  Any antiderivative can be chosen when using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate a definite integral, meaning any value of can be picked. The constant always cancels out of the expression when evaluating , so it does not matter what value is picked. This being the case, we might as well let .   Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2   Evaluate the following definite integrals.           Video solution         .     . (This is interesting; it says that the area under one hump of a sine curve is 2.)     .     .     . This integral is interesting; the integrand is a constant function, hence we are finding the area of a rectangle with width and height 2. Notice how the evaluation of the definite integral led to . In general, if is a constant, then .         Understanding Motion with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  We established, starting with Key Idea , that the derivative of a position function is a velocity function, and the derivative of a velocity function is an acceleration function. Now consider definite integrals of velocity and acceleration functions. Specifically, if is a velocity function, what does mean? integration displacement  displacement   The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that , where is any antiderivative of . Since is a velocity function, must be a position function, and measures a change in position, or displacement .   Finding displacement and distance   A ball is thrown straight up with velocity given by ft\/s, where is measured in seconds. Find, and interpret, and .    Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have .  Thus if a ball is thrown straight up into the air with velocity , the height of the ball, 1 second later, will be 4 feet above the initial height.  Note that the ball has traveled much farther. It has gone up to its peak and is falling down, but the difference between its height at and is 4ft.  If we wish to find the total distance traveled, we must evaluate (noting that negative velocities will reduce the diplacement, but we want distance , not displacement). In this case, we know that the velocity changes sign once when ,so seconds. The velocity is positive over and negative over . Therefore . So the total distance traveled over is .  As we can see in Figure , the positive area between and the -axis, , while the negative area, . When we add these two areas, we get the displacement of ft. But when we add the absolute value of both of these areas (as in Figure ), we get the total distance of ft.    The area between and the -axis can be used to represent displacement        The area between and the -axis can be used to represent distance          Integrating a rate of change function gives total change. Velocity is the rate of position change; integrating velocity gives the total change of position, , displacement.  Integrating a speed function gives a similar, though different, result. Speed is also the rate of position change, but does not account for direction. That is, the speed an object is the absolute value of its velocity. This is what we saw in Example when we evaluated . So integrating a speed function gives total change of position, without the possibility of negative position change. Hence the integral of a speed function gives distance traveled.   As acceleration is the rate of velocity change, integrating an acceleration function gives total change in velocity. We do not have a simple term for this analogous to displacement. If miles\/h and is measured in hours, then means the velocity has increased by 15m\/h from to .    The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Chain Rule  Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) states that given , we have . Using other notation, . While we have just practiced evaluating definite integrals, sometimes finding antiderivatives is impossible and we need to rely on other techniques to approximate the value of a definite integral. Functions written as are useful in such situations.  It may be of further use to compose such a function with another. As an example, we may compose with to get .  What is the derivative of such a function? Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and Chain Rule The Chain Rule can be employed to state .   Video presentation of and    An example will help us understand this.   The FTC, Part 1, and the Chain Rule   Find the derivative of .    We can view as being the function composed with ; that is, . The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that . The Chain Rule gives us   Normally, the steps defining and are skipped.    Let's practice this once more.   The FTC, Part 1, and the Chain Rule   Find the derivative of .    Video solution     Note that . Viewed this way, the derivative of is straightforward: .      Area Between Curves   Video introduction to    Consider continuous functions and defined on , where for all in , as demonstrated in Figure .

Using mathematical notation, the area is .  Properties of the definite integral allow us to simplify this expression to .   Area Between Curves   Let and be continuous functions defined on where for all in . The area of the region bounded by the curves , and the lines and is .     Finding area between curves   Find the area of the region enclosed by and .    Video solution     It will help to sketch these two functions, as done in Figure .   Sketching the region enclosed by and in Example       The region whose area we seek is completely bounded by these two functions; they seem to intersect at and . To check, set and solve for : .  Following Theorem , the area is     One of the things we have to be careful about when finding the area between curves is that the curves might cross, so that the distinction between upper curve and lower curve can change. The video example in illustrates this phenomenon.   Finding the area between curves that intersect multiple times      The Mean Value Theorem and Average Value   A graph of a function to introduce the Mean Value Theorem       Consider the graph of a function in Figure and the area defined by . Three rectangles are drawn in Figure ; in Figure , the height of the rectangle is greater than on , hence the area of this rectangle is is greater than .  In Figure , the height of the rectangle is smaller than on , hence the area of this rectangle is less than .  Finally, in Figure the height of the rectangle is such that the area of the rectangle is exactly that of . Since rectangles that are too big , as in (a), and rectangles that are too little, as in (b), give areas greater\/lesser than , it makes sense that there is a rectangle, whose top intersects somewhere on , whose area is exactly that of the definite integral.   Differently sized rectangles give upper and lower bounds on ; the last rectangle matches the area exactly                          We state this idea formally in a theorem.   The Mean Value Theorem of Integration   Let be continuous on . Mean Value Theorem of integration  integration Mean Value Theorem There exists a value in such that .     Video presentation of    This is an existential statement; exists, but we do not provide a method of finding it. Theorem is directly connected to the Mean Value Theorem of Differentiation, given as Theorem ; we leave it to the reader to see how.   The Theorem simply says that there is a rectangle with height and width , the area of which is the same as the area between and the -axis over . Furthermore, we know that will be in the interval .   We demonstrate the principles involved in this version of the Mean Value Theorem in the following example.   Using the Mean Value Theorem   Consider . Find a value guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem.    We first need to evaluate . (This was previously done in Example .) .  Thus we seek a value in such that . .   A graph of on and the rectangle guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem       In Figure  is sketched along with a rectangle with height . The area of the rectangle is the same as the area under on .    We now turn our attention to a related topic average value. Let be a function on with such that . Consider : .  When is shifted by , the amount of area under above the -axis on is the same as the amount of area below the -axis above ; see Figure for an illustration of this. In this sense, we can say that is the average value of on .    On the left, a graph of and the rectangle guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem. On the right, is shifted down by ; the resulting area under the curve is 0             The value is the average value in another sense. First, recognize that the Mean Value Theorem can be rewritten as , for some value of in . Replacing the integral with the limit of a Riemann sum (as in Theorem ): .  Examining this last line closely, the expression represents adding up sample values of and then dividing by . This is exactly what we do when we calculate the average of a set of numbers. Now when we consider taking the limit as goes to , , we are adding up all of the function's output values over and dividing by the number of numbers . In a sense, we are adding up an infinite number of output values and then dividing by the number of terms we summed (which is again infinite).   This leads us to a definition.   The Average Value of on   Let be continuous on . The average value of on is , where is a value in guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem. integration average value  average value of function  , .     Video presentation of    An application of this definition is given in the following example.   Finding the average value of a function   An object moves back and forth along a straight line with a velocity given by on , where is measured in seconds and is measured in ft\/s.  What is the average velocity of the object?    By our definition, the average velocity is: .    We can understand the above example through a simpler situation. Suppose you drove 100 miles in 2 hours. What was your average speed? The answer is simple: displacement\/time = 100 miles\/2 hours = 50 mph.  What was the displacement of the object in Example ? We calculate this by integrating its velocity function: ft. Its final position was 3 feet from its initial position after 3 seconds: its average velocity was 1 ft\/s.  This section has laid the groundwork for a lot of great mathematics to follow. The most important lesson is this: definite integrals can be evaluated using antiderivatives. Since Section established that definite integrals are the limit of Riemann sums, we can later create Riemann sums to approximate values other than area under the curve, convert the sums to definite integrals, then evaluate these using the . This will allow us to compute the work done by a variable force, the volume of certain solids, the arc length of curves, and more.  The downside is this: generally speaking, computing antiderivatives is much more difficult than computing derivatives. Chapter is devoted to techniques of finding antiderivatives so that a wide variety of definite integrals can be evaluated. Before that, Section explores techniques of approximating the value of definite integrals beyond using the Left Hand, Right Hand and Midpoint Rules. These techniques are invaluable when antiderivatives cannot be computed, or when the actual function is unknown and all we know is the value of at certain -values.     Terms and Concepts    How are definite and indefinite integrals related?          What constant of integration is most commonly used when evaluating definite integrals?                 ?    True    False   If is a continuous function, then is also a continuous function.               The definite integral can be used to find the area under a curve.

  "body": " Numerical Integration   The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives a concrete technique for finding the exact value of a definite integral. That technique is based on computing antiderivatives. Despite the power of this theorem, there are still situations where we must approximate the value of the definite integral instead of finding its exact value. The first situation we explore is where we cannot compute the antiderivative of the integrand. The second case is when we actually do not know the function in the integrand, but only its value when evaluated at certain points. integration numerical  numerical integration   An elementary function  elementary function is any function that is a combination of polynomial, th root, rational, exponential, logarithmic and trigonometric functions. We can compute the derivative of any elementary function, but there are many elementary functions of which we cannot compute an antiderivative. For example, the following functions do not have antiderivatives that we can express with elementary functions:  ,  ,  .    The simplest way to refer to the antiderivatives of is to simply write .  This section outlines three common methods of approximating the value of definite integrals. We describe each as a systematic method of approximating area under a curve. By approximating this area accurately, we find an accurate approximation of the corresponding definite integral.  We will apply the methods we learn in this section to the following definite integrals:  ,  ,  ,  as pictured in Figure .   Graphically representing three definite integrals that cannot be evaluated using antiderivatives                                  The Left and Right Hand Rule Methods  In Section we addressed the problem of evaluating definite integrals by approximating the area under the curve using rectangles. We revisit those ideas here before introducing other methods of approximating definite integrals. numerical integration Left\/Right Hand Rule  Right Hand Rule  Left Hand Rule  integration numerical!Left\/Right Hand Rule   We start with a review of notation. Let be a continuous function on the interval . We wish to approximate . We partition into equally spaced subintervals, each of length . The endpoints of these subintervals are labeled as .   Key Idea states that to use the Left Hand Rule we use the summation and to use the Right Hand Rule we use . We review the use of these rules in the context of examples.   Approximating definite integrals with rectangles   Approximate using the Left and Right Hand Rules with 5 equally spaced subintervals.    We begin by partitioning the interval into 5 equally spaced intervals. We have , so .  Using the Left Hand Rule, we have: .  Using the Right Hand Rule, we have: .   Approximating in Example     Using the Left Hand Rule          Using the Right Hand Rule           Figure shows the rectangles used in each method to approximate the definite integral. These graphs show that in this particular case, the Left Hand Rule is an over approximation and the Right Hand Rule is an under approximation. To get a better approximation, we could use more rectangles, as we did in Section . We could also average the Left and Right Hand Rule results together, giving .  The actual answer, accurate to 4 places after the decimal, is 0.7468, showing our average is a good approximation.     Approximating definite integrals with rectangles   Approximate using the Left and Right Hand Rules with 10 equally spaced subintervals.    We begin by finding : .  It is useful to write out the endpoints of the subintervals in a table; in , we give the exact values of the endpoints, their decimal approximations, and decimal approximations of evaluated at these points.   Table of values used to approximate in Example     Exact  Approx.                                                                              Once this table is created, it is straightforward to approximate the definite integral using the Left and Right Hand Rules. (Note: the table itself is easy to create, especially with a standard spreadsheet program on a computer. The last two columns are all that are needed.) The Left Hand Rule sums the first 10 values of and multiplies the sum by ; the Right Hand Rule sums the last 10 values of and multiplies by . Therefore we have:  Left Hand Rule: .  Right Hand Rule: .  Average of the Left and Right Hand Rules: 0.4258.   Approximating in Example                       The actual answer, accurate to 4 places after the decimal, is 0.4609. Our approximations were once again fairly good. The rectangles used in each approximation are shown in Figure . It is clear from the graphs that using more rectangles (and hence, narrower rectangles) should result in a more accurate approximation.      The Trapezoidal Rule  In Example we approximated the value of with 5 rectangles of equal width. Figure shows the rectangles used in the Left and Right Hand Rules. These graphs clearly show that rectangles do not match the shape of the graph all that well, and that accurate approximations will only come by using lots of rectangles. Trapezoidal Rule  numerical integration Trapezoidal Rule  integration numerical!Trapezoidal Rule   Instead of using rectangles to approximate the area, we can instead use trapezoids. In Figure , we show the region under on approximated with 5 trapezoids of equal width; the top corners of each trapezoid lies on the graph of . It is clear from this figure that these trapezoids more accurately approximate the area under and hence should give a better approximation of . (In fact, these trapezoids seem to give a great approximation of the area!)   Approximating using 5 trapezoids of equal widths         The formula for the area of a trapezoid is given in Figure . We approximate with these trapezoids in the following example.   The area of a trapezoid          Approximating definite integrals using trapezoids   Use 5 trapezoids of equal width to approximate .    To compute the areas of the 5 trapezoids in Figure , it will again be useful to create a table of values as shown in .   A table of values of                                     The leftmost trapezoid has legs of length and and a height of 0.2. Thus, by our formula, the area of the leftmost trapezoid is: .  Moving right, the next trapezoid has legs of length and and a height of 0.2. Thus its area is: .  The sum of the areas of all 5 trapezoids is: .  We approximate .    There are many things to observe in this example. Note how each term in the final summation was multiplied by both 1\/2 and by . We can factor these coefficients out, leaving a more concise summation as: .  Now notice that all numbers except for the first and the last are added twice. Therefore we can write the summation even more concisely as .  This is the heart of the Trapezoidal Rule , wherein a definite integral is approximated by using trapezoids of equal widths to approximate the corresponding area under . Using equally spaced subintervals with endpoints , , , , we again have . Thus: .   Using the Trapezoidal Rule   Revisit Example and approximate using the Trapezoidal Rule and 10 equally spaced subintervals.    We refer back to for the table of values of . Recall that . Thus we have: . The actual answer, accurate to 4 decimal places is . So the Trapezoidal Rule with 10 subintervals is an under-approximation by about .    Notice how quickly the Trapezoidal Rule can be implemented once the table of values is created. This is true for all the methods explored in this section; the real work is creating a table of and values. Once this is completed, approximating the definite integral is not difficult. Again, using technology is wise. Spreadsheets can make quick work of these computations and make using lots of subintervals easy.  Also notice the approximations the Trapezoidal Rule gives. It is the average of the approximations given by the Left and Right Hand Rules! This effectively renders the Left and Right Hand Rules obsolete. They are useful when first learning about definite integrals, but if a real approximation is needed, one is generally better off using the Trapezoidal Rule instead of either the Left or Right Hand Rule. However, there are two other methods that are also generally more accurate than the Left or Right Hand Rule.    The Midpoint Rule  Another method that can be more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule is the Midpoint Rule:    Using the Midpoint Rule   Use the Midpoint Rule with to approximate .    We cannot use the same table ( Table ) that we used for the Trapezoidal, Right and Left Hand Rules when using the Midpoint Rule. The Trapezoidal rule averages the outputs of the function to obtain a more accurate estimate of the definite integral. The Midpoint Rule averages the inputs of each subinterval to create a rectangle with height . Generally .  So we will create a new table of values as shown in Table . We have . The midpoint of the first subinteval is at and each successive midpoint is from the last.   A table of values of                                 So we have   We approximate .     Using the Midpoint Rule   Revisit Example and approximate using the Midpoint Rule and 10 equally spaced subintervals.    Again, a table will be useful. Recall that . The midpoint of the first subinterval is (notice that is half of a subinterval width to the right of ). Each successive midpoint is to the right of the last. So we have:   Table of values used to approximate in Example     Exact  Approx.                                                                           Thus we have: . The actual answer, accurate to 4 decimal places is . So the Midpoint Rule with 10 subintervals is an overrapproximation by about . Notice that this error is about half of the error in using the Trapezoidal Rule.    In many cases, the Midpoint Rule will more accurate than the Trapezoidal Rule. You may wonder though, how can we improve on the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules, apart from using more and more subintervals? The answer is clear once we look back and consider what we have really done so far. The Left Hand Rule, Right Hand Rule and Midpoint Rules are not really about using rectangles to approximate area. Instead, they approximate a function with constant functions on small subintervals and then compute the definite integral of these constant functions. The Trapezoidal Rule is really approximating a function with a linear function on a small subinterval, then computing the definite integral of this linear function. In all of these cases the definite integrals are easy to compute in geometric terms.  So we have a progression: we start by approximating with a constant function and then with a linear function. What is next? A quadratic function. By approximating the curve of a function with lots of parabolas, we generally get an even better approximation of the definite integral. We call this process Simpson's Rule , named after Thomas Simpson (1710-1761), even though others had used this rule as much as 100 years prior.    Simpson's Rule  Given one point, we can create a constant function that goes through that point. Given two points, we can create a linear function that goes through those points. Given three points, we can create a quadratic function that goes through those three points (given that no two have the same -value). Simpson's Rule  numerical integration Simpson's Rule  integration numerical!Simpson's Rule   Consider three points , and whose -values are equally spaced and . Let be the quadratic function that goes through these three points. It is not hard to show that .     While it's not hard to show the results of Equation , it's also not exactly easy. This video might help:         Consider Figure . A function goes through the 3 points shown and the parabola that also goes through those points is graphed with a dashed line. Using our equation from above, we know exactly that .  Since is a good approximation for on , we can state that .   A graph of a function and a parabola that approximates it well on         Notice how the interval was split into two subintervals as we needed 3 points. Because of this, whenever we use Simpson's Rule, we need to break the interval into an even number of subintervals.  In general, to approximate using Simpson's Rule, subdivide into subintervals, where is even and each subinterval has width . We approximate with parabolic curves, using Equation to compute the area under these parabolas. Adding up these areas gives the formula: .  Note how the coefficients of the terms in the summation have the pattern 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, , 2, 4, 1.   Figure illustrates how the area calculated by Simpson's Rule approximates for the function . In this case, subintervals were used, resulting in quadratic curves (dashed lines) being fitted to each pair of subintervals. The actual answer (accurate to decimal places) is about , while Simpson's rule gives . Of course more subintervals would result in better accuracy. However intervals were chosen specifically so that you could see how the parabolas compare to the original function. With larger values of , it becomes difficult to distinguish the function and its quadratic approximations on each subinterval.   An illustration of Simpson's rule on over using subintervals, resulting in quadratic approximations       Let's demonstrate Simpson's Rule with a concrete example.   Using Simpson's Rule   Approximate using Simpson's Rule and 4 equally spaced subintervals.    We begin by making a table of values as we have in the past, as shown in .   A table of values to approximate , along with a graph of the function                                                 Simpson's Rule states that .  Recall in Example we stated that the correct answer, accurate to 4 places after the decimal, was 0.7468. Our approximation with Simpson's Rule, with 4 subintervals, is better than our approximation with the Trapezoidal Rule using 5!   Figure shows along with its approximating parabolas, demonstrating how good our approximation is. The approximating curves are nearly indistinguishable from the actual function.     Using Simpson's Rule   Approximate using Simpson's Rule and 10 equally spaced intervals.     shows the table of values that we used in the past for this problem, shown here again for convenience. Again, .   Table of values used to approximate in Example                                                     Simpson's Rule states that    Approximating in Example with Simpson's Rule and 10 equally spaced intervals         Recall that the actual value, accurate to 3 decimal places, is 0.4609. Our approximation is within one th of the correct value. The graph in Figure shows how closely the parabolas match the shape of the graph.      Summary and Error Analysis  We summarize the key concepts of this section thus far in the following Key Idea.   Numerical Integration  Let be a continuous function on , let be a positive integer, and let . integration numerical!Left\/Right Hand Rule  integration numerical!Trapezoidal Rule  integration numerical!Simpson's Rule  Left\/Right Hand Rule  Trapezoidal Rule  Simpson's Rule  numerical integration Left\/Right Hand Rule  numerical integration Trapezoidal Rule  numerical integration Simpson's Rule   Set , , , , .  Consider .  Left Hand Rule: .  Right Hand Rule: .  Trapezoidal Rule: .  Midpoint Rule: .  Simpson's Rule: .   In our examples, we approximated the value of a definite integral using a given method then compared it to the right answer. This should have raised several questions in the reader's mind, such as:     How was the right answer computed?    If the right answer can be found, what is the point of approximating?    If there is value to approximating, how are we supposed to know if the approximation is any good?     These are good questions, and their answers are educational. In the examples, the right answer was never computed. Rather, an approximation accurate to a certain number of places after the decimal was given. In Example , we do not know the exact answer, but we know it starts with . These more accurate approximations were computed using numerical integration but with more precision ( , more subintervals and the help of a computer).  Since the exact answer cannot be found, approximation still has its place. How are we to tell if the approximation is any good?   Trial and error provides one way. Using technology, make an approximation with, say, 10, 100, and 200 subintervals. This likely will not take much time at all, and a trend should emerge. If a trend does not emerge, try using yet more subintervals. Keep in mind that trial and error is never foolproof; you might stumble upon a problem in which a trend will not emerge.  A second method is to use Error Analysis. While the details are beyond the scope of this text, there are some formulas that give bounds for how good your approximation will be. For instance, the formula might state that the approximation is within 0.1 of the correct answer. If the approximation is 1.58, then one knows that the correct answer is between 1.48 and 1.68. By using lots of subintervals, one can get an approximation as accurate as one likes. Theorem states what these bounds are.   Error Bounds in the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule    integration numerical!Trapezoidal Rule  integration numerical!Simpson's Rule  Trapezoidal Rule error bounds  Simpson's Rule error bounds  numerical integration Trapezoidal Rule!error bounds  numerical integration Simpson's Rule!error bounds    Let and be the error in approximating using the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules respectively, with subintervals. If has a continuous second derivative on and is any upper bound of on , then . and .    Let be the error in approximating using Simpson's Rule with subintervals.. If has a continuous th derivative on and is any upper bound of on , then .       There are some key things to note about this theorem.   The larger the interval, the larger the error. This should make sense intuitively.    The error shrinks as more subintervals are used ( , as gets larger).    The maximum error in the Midpoint Rule is half of the maximum error in the Trapezoidal Rule. ( Usually the errors in these two rules have opposite signs as well, that is one will be an under approximation and the other will be an over approximation).    The error in Simpson's Rule has a term relating to the th derivative of . Consider a cubic polynomial: its th derivative is 0. Therefore, the error in approximating the definite integral of a cubic polynomial with Simpson's Rule is  Simpson's Rule computes the exact answer!     We revisit Examples and and compute the error bounds using Theorem in the following example.   Computing error bounds   Find the error bounds when approximating using the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules and 5 subintervals, and using Simpson's Rule with 4 subintervals.     Trapezoidal and Midpoints Rules with :   We start by computing the nd derivative of : .   Figure shows a graph of on . It is clear that the largest value of , in absolute value, is 2.   Graphing in Example to help establish error bounds         Thus we let and apply the error formula from Theorem . . Since the maximum error in the Midpoint rule is half the error in the Trapezoidal Rule, we can say:    Our error estimation formula states that our approximation of 0.7444 found in Example is within 0.0067 of the correct answer. Hence we know that the actual value is within So: But we can do better than this with the Midpoint Rule since its error is at most half of the error of the Trapezoidal Rule. Our error estimate formula state that our approximate of found in Example is within of the correct answer. Hence Hence we know that the actual value is within .  We had earlier stated the actual answer, correct to 4 decimal places, to be 0.7468, affirming the validity of Theorem .   Simpson's Rule with :   We start by computing the th derivative of : .   Figure shows a graph of on . It is clear that the largest value of , in absolute value, is 12. Thus we let and apply the error formula from Theorem . .   Graphing in Example to help establish error bounds         Our error estimation formula states that our approximation of found in Example is within of the correct answer, hence we know that the correct answer is in the interval So: .  Once again we affirm the validity of Theorem since the answer to 4 decimal places is actually .    At the beginning of this section we mentioned two main situations where numerical integration was desirable. We have considered the case where an antiderivative of the integrand cannot be computed. We now investigate the situation where the integrand is not known. This is, in fact, the most widely used application of Numerical Integration methods. Most of the time we observe behavior but do not know the function that describes it. We instead collect data about the behavior and make approximations based on this data. We demonstrate this in an example.   Approximating distance traveled   One of the authors drove his daughter home from school while she recorded their speed every 30 seconds. The data is given in . Approximate the distance they traveled.   Speed data collected at 30 second intervals for Example    Time Speed    (min) ( )                                                                                                           Recall that by integrating a speed function we get distance traveled. We have information about ; we will use Simpson's Rule to approximate .  The most difficult aspect of this problem is converting the given data into the form we need it to be in. The speed is measured in miles per hour, whereas the time is measured in minutes.  We need to compute . With 25 data points collected, there are subintervals. What are and ? Since we start at time , we have . The final recorded time was minutes, which is 1\/5 of an hour. Thus we have .  Thus the distance traveled is approximately:   We approximate the author drove 6.2 miles. (Because we are sure the reader wants to know, the author's odometer recorded the distance as about 6.05 miles.)       Terms and Concepts    T\/F: Simpson s Rule is a method of approximating antiderivatives.   ?    True    False                What are the two basic situations where approximating the value of a definite integral is necessary?         Why are the Left and Right Hand Rules rarely used?   They are superseded by the Trapezoidal Rule; it takes an equal amount of work and is generally more accurate.         Simpson's Rule is based on approximating portions of a function with what type of function?

  "body": " Substitution    Video introduction to    We motivate this section with an example. Let . We can compute using the Chain Rule. It is: .  Now consider this: What is ? We have the answer in front of us; .  How would we have evaluated this indefinite integral without starting with as we did?  This section explores integration by substitution. It allows us to undo the Chain Rule. Substitution allows us to evaluate the above integral without knowing the original function first.  The underlying principle is to rewrite a complicated integral of the form as a not-so-complicated integral . We'll formally establish later how this is done. First, consider again our introductory indefinite integral, . Arguably the most complicated part of the integrand is . We wish to make this simpler; we do so through a substitution. Let . Thus .  We have established as a function of , so now consider the differential of : .  Keep in mind that and are multiplied; the is not just sitting there.   Return to the original integral and do some substitutions through algebra:   One might well look at this and think I (sort of) followed how that worked, but I could never come up with that on my own, but the process is learnable. This section contains numerous examples through which the reader will gain understanding and mathematical maturity enabling them to regard substitution as a natural tool when evaluating integrals.  We stated before that integration by substitution undoes the Chain Rule. Specifically, let and be differentiable functions and consider the derivative of their composition: .  Thus .  Integration by substitution works by recognizing the inside function and replacing it with a variable. By setting , we can rewrite the derivative as .  Since , we can rewrite the above integral as .  This concept is important so we restate it in the context of a theorem.   Integration by Substitution   Let and be differentiable functions, where the range of is an interval contained in the domain of . Then integration by substitution  .  If , then and .    The point of substitution is to make the integration step easy. Indeed, the step looks easy, as the antiderivative of the derivative of is just , plus a constant. The work involved is making the proper substitution. There is not a step-by-step process that one can memorize; rather, experience will be one's guide. To gain experience, we now embark on many examples.   Integrating by substitution   Evaluate .    Knowing that substitution is related to the Chain Rule, we choose to let be the inside function of . (This is not always a good choice, but it is often the best place to start.)  Let , hence . The integrand has an term, but not a term. (Recall that multiplication is commutative, so the does not physically have to be next to for there to be an term.) We can divide both sides of the expression by 2: .  We can now substitute. .  Thus . We can check our work by evaluating the derivative of the right hand side.     Integrating by substitution   Evaluate .    Again let replace the inside function. Letting , we have . Since our integrand does not have a term, we can divide the previous equation by to obtain . We can now substitute. .  We can again check our work through differentiation.    The previous example exhibited a common, and simple, type of substitution. The inside function was a linear function (in this case, ). When the inside function is linear, the resulting integration is very predictable, outlined here.   Substitution With A Linear Function  Consider , where and are constants. Letting gives , leading to the result .   Thus . Our next example can use Key Idea , but we will only employ it after going through all of the steps.   Integrating by substituting a linear function   Evaluate .    View the integrand as the composition of functions , where and . Employing our understanding of substitution, we let , the inside function. Thus . The integrand lacks a ; hence divide the previous equation by to obtain . We can now evaluate the integral through substitution. .  Using Key Idea is faster, recognizing that is linear and . One may want to continue writing out all the steps until they are comfortable with this particular shortcut.     Video presentation of Examples    Not all integrals that benefit from substitution have a clear inside function. Several of the following examples will demonstrate ways in which this occurs.   Integrating by substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     There is not a composition of functions here to exploit; rather, just a product of functions. Do not be afraid to experiment; when given an integral to evaluate, it is often beneficial to think If I let be this , then must be that  and see if this helps simplify the integral at all.  In this example, let's set . Then , which we have as part of the integrand! The substitution becomes very straightforward: .  One would do well to ask What would happen if we let ? The result is just as easy to find, yet looks very different. The challenge to the reader is to evaluate the integral letting and discover why the answer is the same, yet looks different.    Our examples so far have required basic substitution. The next example demonstrates how substitutions can be made that often strike the new learner as being nonstandard.    Integrating by substitution   Evaluate .    Recognizing the composition of functions, set . Then , giving what seems initially to be a simple substitution. But at this stage, we have: .  We cannot evaluate an integral that has both an and an in it. We need to convert the to an expression involving just .  Since we set , we can also state that . Thus we can replace in the integrand with . It will also be helpful to rewrite as . .  Checking your work is always a good idea. In this particular case, some algebra will be needed to make one's answer match the integrand in the original problem.     Integrating by substitution   Evaluate .    This is another example where there does not seem to be an obvious composition of functions. The line of thinking used in Example is useful here: choose something for and consider what this implies must be. If can be chosen such that also appears in the integrand, then we have chosen well.  Choosing makes ; that does not seem helpful. However, setting makes , which is part of the integrand. Thus: .  The final answer is interesting; the natural log of the natural log. Take the derivative to confirm this answer is indeed correct.     Video presentation of Examples      Integrals Involving Trigonometric Functions   Section delves deeper into integrals of a variety of trigonometric functions; here we use substitution to establish a foundation that we will build upon.  The next three examples will help fill in some missing pieces of our antiderivative knowledge. We know the antiderivatives of the sine and cosine functions; what about the other standard functions tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant? We discover these next.   Integrating by substitution: the antiderivative of   Evaluate .    Video solution     The previous paragraph established that we did not know the antiderivatives of tangent, hence we must assume that we have learned something in this section that can help us evaluate this indefinite integral.  Rewrite as . While the presence of a composition of functions may not be immediately obvious, recognize that is inside the function. Therefore, we see if setting returns usable results. We have that , hence . We can integrate: .  Some texts prefer to bring the inside the logarithm as a power of , as in: .  Thus the result they give is . These two answers are equivalent.     Integrating by substitution: the antiderivative of   Evaluate .    Video solution     This example employs a wonderful trick: multiply the integrand by 1 so that we see how to integrate more clearly. In this case, we write 1 as .  This may seem like it came out of left field, but it works beautifully. Consider: .     We can use similar techniques to those used in Examples and to find antiderivatives of and (which the reader can explore in the exercises.) We summarize our results here.   Antiderivatives of Trigonometric Functions    integration of trig. functions       ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,      We explore one more common trigonometric integral.   Integration by substitution: powers of and   Evaluate .    We have a composition of functions as . However, setting means , which we do not have in the integral. Another technique is needed.   The power reduction identities can be found in List in .   The process we'll employ is to use a Power Reducing formula for , which states .  The right hand side of this equation is not difficult to integrate. We have: , where we used Key Idea for the antiderivative of .  We'll make significant use of this power-reducing technique in future sections.     Video presentation of and two other trigonometric examples      Simplifying the Integrand  It is common to be reluctant to manipulate the integrand of an integral; at first, our grasp of integration is tenuous and one may think that working with the integrand will improperly change the results. Integration by substitution works using a different logic: as long as equality is maintained, the integrand can be manipulated so that its form is easier to deal with. The next two examples demonstrate common ways in which using algebra first makes the integration easier to perform.   Integration by substitution: simplifying first   Evaluate .    Video solution     One may try to start by setting equal to either the numerator or denominator; in each instance, the result is not workable.  When dealing with rational functions ( , quotients made up of polynomial functions), it is an almost universal rule that everything works better when the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Hence we use polynomial division.  We skip the specifics of the steps, but note that when is divided into , it goes in times with a remainder of . Thus .   Integrating is simple. The fraction can be integrated by setting , giving . This is very similar to the numerator. Note that and then consider the following: .  In some ways, we lucked out in that after dividing, substitution was able to be done. In later sections we'll develop techniques for handling rational functions where substitution is not directly feasible.     Integration by alternate methods   Evaluate with, and without, substitution.    We already know how to integrate this particular example. Rewrite as and simplify the fraction: .  We can now integrate using the Power Rule:   This is a perfectly fine approach. We demonstrate how this can also be solved using substitution as its implementation is rather clever.  Let ; therefore .  This gives us . What are we to do with the other terms? Since , , etc. We can then replace and with appropriate powers of . We thus have , which is obviously the same answer we obtained before. In this situation, substitution is arguably more work than our other method. The fantastic thing is that it works. It demonstrates how flexible integration is.      Substitution and Inverse Trigonometric Functions  When studying derivatives of inverse functions, we learned that .  Applying the Chain Rule to this is not difficult; for instance, .  We now explore how Substitution can be used to undo certain derivatives that are the result of the Chain Rule applied to Inverse Trigonometric functions. We begin with an example.   Integrating by substitution: inverse trigonometric functions   Evaluate .    Video solution     The integrand looks similar to the derivative of the arctangent function. Note: .  Thus .  This can be integrated using Substitution. Set , hence or . Thus      Example demonstrates a general technique that can be applied to other integrands that result in inverse trigonometric functions. The results are summarized here.   Integrals Involving Inverse Trigonometric Functions   Let .           Let's practice using Theorem .   Integrating by substitution: inverse trigonometric functions   Evaluate the given indefinite integrals:         Each can be answered using a straightforward application of Theorem .    , as .     , as .     , as .       Most applications of Theorem are not as straightforward. The next examples show some common integrals that can still be approached with this theorem.   Integrating by substitution: completing the square   Evaluate .    Video solution     Initially, this integral seems to have nothing in common with the integrals in Theorem . As it lacks a square root, it almost certainly is not related to arcsine or arcsecant. It is, however, related to the arctangent function.  We see this by completing the square in the denominator. We give a brief reminder of the process here.  Start with a quadratic with a leading coefficient of 1. It will have the form of . Take 1\/2 of , square it, and add\/subtract it back into the expression. ,   In our example, we take half of and square it, getting . We add\/subtract it into the denominator as follows:   We can now integrate this using the arctangent rule. Technically, we need to substitute first with , but we can employ Key Idea instead. Thus we have .     Integrals requiring multiple methods   Evaluate .    Video solution     This integral requires two different methods to evaluate it. We get to those methods by splitting up the integral into two terms: .  We handle each separately. The first integral is handled using a straightforward application of Theorem :   .  The second integral is handled by substitution, with . : Set , so and . We have .  Combining these together, we have . As with all definite integrals, you can check your work by differentiation.      Substitution and Definite Integration   Video introduction to    This section has focused on evaluating indefinite integrals as we are learning a new technique for finding antiderivatives. However, much of the time integration is used in the context of a definite integral. Definite integrals that require substitution can be calculated using the following workflow:     Start with a definite integral that requires substitution.    Ignore the bounds; use substitution to evaluate and find an antiderivative .    Evaluate at the bounds; that is, evaluate .     This workflow works fine, but substitution offers an alternative that is powerful and amazing (and a little time saving).  At its heart, (using the notation of Theorem ) substitution converts integrals of the form into an integral of the form with the substitution of . The following theorem states how the bounds of a definite integral can be changed as the substitution is performed.   Substitution with Definite Integrals   Let and be differentiable functions, where the range of is an interval that is contained in the domain of and . Then integration definite!and substitution  definite integral and substitution  .    In effect, Theorem states that once you convert to integrating with respect to , you do not need to switch back to evaluating with respect to . A few examples will help one understand.   Definite integrals and substitution: changing the bounds   Evaluate using Theorem .    Observing the composition of functions, let , hence . As does not appear in the integrand, divide the latter equation by 3 to get .  By setting , we are implicitly stating that . Theorem states that the new lower bound is ; the new upper bound is . We now evaluate the definite integral: .  Notice how once we converted the integral to be in terms of , we never went back to using .   Graphing the areas defined by the definite integrals of Example                       The graphs in Figure tell more of the story. In Figure the area defined by the original integrand is shaded, whereas in Figure the area defined by the new integrand is shaded. In this particular situation, the areas look very similar; the new region is shorter but wider, giving the same area.     Definite integrals and substitution: changing the bounds   Evaluate using Theorem .    Video solution     We saw the corresponding indefinite integral in Example . In that example we set but stated that we could have let . For variety, we do the latter here.  Let , giving and hence . The new upper bound is ; the new lower bound is . Note how the lower bound is actually larger than the upper bound now. We have .  In Figure we have again graphed the two regions defined by our definite integrals. Unlike the previous example, they bear no resemblance to each other. However, Theorem guarantees that they have the same area.   Graphing the areas defined by the definite integrals of Example                         Integration by substitution is a powerful and useful integration technique. The next section introduces another technique, called Integration by Parts. As substitution undoes the Chain Rule, integration by parts undoes the Product Rule. Together, these two techniques provide a strong foundation on which most other integration techniques are based.     Terms and Concepts    Substitution undoes what derivative rule?                ?    True    False   One can use algebra to rewrite the integrand of an integral to make it easier to evaluate.              Problems    Evaluate the indefinite integral to develop an understanding of Substitution.

Do not just refer to Theorem 6.1.14 for the answer; justify it through Substitution.                Do not just refer to Theorem 6.1.14 for the answer; justify it through Substitution.

Video solution     One may try to start by setting equal to either the numerator or denominator; in each instance, the result is not workable.  When dealing with rational functions ( , quotients made up of polynomial functions), it is an almost universal rule that everything works better when the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Hence we use polynomial division.  We skip the specifics of the steps, but note that when is divided into , it goes in times with a remainder of . Thus .   Integrating is simple. The fraction can be integrated by setting , giving . This is very similar to the numerator. Note that and then consider the following: .  In some ways, we lucked out in that after dividing, substitution was able to be done.

  "body": " Integration by Parts  Here's a simple integral that we can't yet evaluate: .  It's a simple matter to take the derivative of the integrand using the Product Rule, but there is no Product Rule for integrals. However, this section introduces Integration by Parts , a method of integration that is based on the Product Rule for derivatives. It will enable us to evaluate this integral.   Video introduction to    The Product Rule says that if and are functions of , then . For simplicity, we've written for and for . Suppose we integrate both sides with respect to . This gives .  By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the left side integrates to . The right side can be broken up into two integrals, and we have .  Solving for the second integral we have .  Using differential notation, we can write and and the expression above can be written as follows: .  This is the Integration by Parts formula. For reference purposes, we state this in a theorem.   Integration by Parts   Let and be differentiable functions of on an interval containing and . Then , and integration by parts  .     The integration by parts formula can also be written as for differentiable functions and .   Let's try an example to understand our new technique.   Integrating using Integration by Parts   Evaluate .    Video solution     The key to Integration by Parts is to identify part of the integrand as and part as . Regular practice will help one make good identifications, and later we will introduce some principles that help. For now, let and .  It is generally useful to make a small table of these values as done below. Right now we only know and as shown on the left of Figure ; on the right we fill in the rest of what we need. If , then . Since , is an antiderivative of . We choose .   Setting up Integration by Parts              Now substitute all of this into the Integration by Parts formula, giving .  We can then integrate to get and overall our answer is .  Note how the antiderivative contains a product, . This product is what makes Integration by Parts necessary.  We can check our work by taking the derivative: .    You may wonder what would have happened in Example if we had chosen our and differently. If we had chosen and then and . Our second integral is not simpler than the first; we would have . The only way to approach this second integral would be yet another integration by parts.   Example demonstrates how Integration by Parts works in general. We try to identify and in the integral we are given, and the key is that we usually want to choose and so that is simpler than and is hopefully not too much more complicated than . This will mean that the integral on the right side of the Integration by Parts formula, will be simpler to integrate than the original integral .  In the example above, we chose and . Then was simpler than and is no more complicated than . Therefore, instead of integrating , we could integrate , which we knew how to do.  A useful mnemonic for helping to determine is LIATE , where   L = L ogarithmic, I = I nverse Trig., A = A lgebraic (polynomials, roots, power functions), T = T rigonometric, and E = E xponential.  If the integrand contains both a logarithmic and an algebraic term, in general letting be the logarithmic term works best, as indicated by L coming before A in LIATE .  We now consider another example.   Integrating using Integration by Parts   Evaluate .    The integrand contains an A lgebraic term ( ) and an E xponential term ( ). Our mnemonic suggests letting be the algebraic term, so we choose and . Then and as indicated by the tables below.   Setting up Integration by Parts              We see is simpler than , while there is no change in going from to . This is good. The Integration by Parts formula gives .  The integral on the right is simple; our final answer is .  Note again how the antiderivatives contain a product term.     Integrating using Integration by Parts   Evaluate .    Video solution     The mnemonic suggests letting instead of the trigonometric function, hence . Then and as shown below.   Setting up Integration by Parts              The Integration by Parts formula gives .  At this point, the integral on the right is indeed simpler than the one we started with, but to evaluate it, we need to do Integration by Parts again. Here we choose and and fill in the rest below. (We are choosing new names since we have already used and . Our integration by parts formula is now .)   Setting up Integration by Parts (again)               .  The integral all the way on the right is now something we can evaluate. It evaluates to . Then going through and simplifying, being careful to keep all the signs straight, our answer is .     Integrating using Integration by Parts   Evaluate .    Video solution     This is a classic problem. Our mnemonic suggests letting be the trigonometric function instead of the exponential. In this particular example, one can let be either or ; to demonstrate that we do not have to follow LIATE , we choose and hence . Then and as shown below.   Setting up Integration by Parts              Notice that is no simpler than , going against our general rule (but bear with us). The Integration by Parts formula yields .  The integral on the right is not much different than the one we started with, so it seems like we have gotten nowhere. Let's keep working and apply Integration by Parts to the new integral, using and . This leads us to the following:   Setting up Integration by Parts (again)              The Integration by Parts formula then gives: .  It seems we are back right where we started, as the right hand side contains . But this is actually a good thing.  Add to both sides. This gives .  Simplifying a little, our answer is thus .

That is because can't easily be integrated with any of the rules we have learned up to this point. But we can find its antiderivative by a clever application of Integration by Parts. Set and . This is a good, sneaky trick to learn as it can help in other situations. This determines and as shown below.   Setting up Integration by Parts              Putting this all together in the Integration by Parts formula, things work out very nicely: .  The new integral simplifies to , which is about as simple as things get. Its integral is and our answer is .     Integrating using Int. by Parts: antiderivative of   Evaluate .    Video solution     The same sneaky trick we used above works here. Let and . Then and . The Integration by Parts formula gives .  The integral on the right can be solved by substitution. Taking , we get . The integral then becomes .  The integral on the right evaluates to , which becomes (we can drop the absolute values as is always positive). Therefore, the answer is .     Substitution Before Integration  When taking derivatives, it was common to employ multiple rules (such as using both the Quotient and the Chain Rules). It should then come as no surprise that some integrals are best evaluated by combining integration techniques. In particular, here we illustrate making an unusual substitution first before using Integration by Parts.   Integration by Parts after substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     The integrand contains a composition of functions, leading us to think Substitution would be beneficial. Letting , we have . This seems problematic, as we do not have a in the integrand. But consider: .  Since , we can use inverse functions and conclude that . Therefore we have that .  We can thus replace with and with . Thus we rewrite our integral as .  We evaluated this integral on the right in Example . (This integral can also be found in a table of integrals). Using the result there, we have: .      Definite Integrals and Integration By Parts  So far we have focused only on evaluating indefinite integrals. Of course, we can use Integration by Parts to evaluate definite integrals as well, as Theorem states. We do so in the next example.   Definite integration using Integration by Parts   Evaluate .    Video solution     Our mnemonic suggests letting , hence . We then get and as shown below.   Setting up Integration by Parts              The Integration by Parts formula then gives .    In general, Integration by Parts is useful for integrating certain products of functions, like or . It is also useful for integrals involving logarithms and inverse trigonometric functions.  As stated before, integration is generally more difficult than derivation. We are developing tools for handling a large array of integrals, and experience will tell us when one tool is preferable\/necessary over another. For instance, consider the three similar-looking integrals .  While the first is calculated easily with Integration by Parts, the second is best approached with Substitution. Taking things one step further, the third integral has no answer in terms of elementary functions, so none of the methods we learn in calculus will get us the exact answer.  Integration by Parts is a very useful method, second only to Substitution. In the following sections of this chapter, we continue to learn other integration techniques. Section focuses on handling integrals containing trigonometric functions.     Terms and Concepts      ?    True    False   Integration by Parts is useful in evaluating integrands that contain products of functions.                 ?    True    False   Integration by Parts can be thought of as the opposite of the Chain Rule.               For what is LIATE useful?   Determining which functions in the integrand to set equal to and which to set equal to .            ?    True    False   If the integral that results from Integration by Parts appears to also need Integration by Parts, then a mistake was made in the original choice of .        F; it is not uncommon to need to use Integration by Parts several times to fully evaluate an integral.         Problems    Evaluate the given indefinite integral.

  "title": "Trigonometric Integrals",
  "body": " Trigonometric Integrals   Functions involving trigonometric functions are useful as they are good at describing periodic behavior. This section describes several techniques for finding antiderivatives of certain combinations of trigonometric functions.    Integrals of the form  In learning the technique of Substitution, we saw the integral in Example . The integration was not difficult, and one could easily evaluate the indefinite integral by letting or by letting . This integral is easy since the power of both sine and cosine is 1.  We generalize this integral and consider integrals of the form , where are nonnegative integers. Our strategy for evaluating these integrals is to use the identity to convert high powers of one trigonometric function into the other, leaving a single sine or cosine term in the integrand. Let's see an example of how this technique works.   Integrating powers of sine and cosine   Evaluate .    Video solution     We have used substitution on problems similar to this problem in Section . If we let , then , and . But what if, for some reason, we wanted to let instead? Unfortunately, we have as part of our integrand, not just . The solution to this problem is to replace some of our powers of sine (two of them to be exact) with expressions that involve cosine. We will use the Pythagorean Identity . .  Now we let so that . .  This looks like a very different answer, so you might wonder if we went wrong somewhere. But in fact, the two answers are equivalent, in the sense that they differ by a constant! (So the is different in each case, if you like.) Notice that , so the difference between the two answers is the constant .    We summarize the general technique in the following Key Idea.   Integrals Involving Powers of Sine and Cosine  Consider , where are nonnegative integers. integration of trig. powers      If is odd, then for some integer . Rewrite . Then , where and .    If is odd, then using substitutions similar to that outlined above (replacing all of the even powers of using a Pythagorean identity) we have: , where and .    If both and are even, use the power-reducing identities: to reduce the degree of the integrand. Expand the result and apply the principles of this Key Idea again.      We practice applying Key Idea in the next examples.   Integrating powers of sine and cosine   Evaluate .    Video solution     The power of the sine term is odd, so we rewrite as .  Our integral is now . Let , hence . Making the substitution and expanding the integrand gives .  This final integral is not difficult to evaluate, giving .     Integrating powers of sine and cosine   Evaluate .    The powers of both the sine and cosine terms are odd, therefore we can apply the techniques of Key Idea to either power. We choose to work with the power of the cosine term since the previous example used the sine term's power.  We rewrite as .  We rewrite the integral as .  Now substitute and integrate, using and . Expand the binomial using algebra.   .     Technology Note: The work we are doing here can be a bit tedious, but the skills developed (problem solving, algebraic manipulation, etc.) are important. Nowadays problems of this sort are often solved using a computer algebra system. The powerful program Mathematica integrates as , which clearly has a different form than our answer in Example , which is .   Figure shows a graph of and ; they are clearly not equal, but they differ only by a constant . That is for some constant . So we have two different antiderivatives of the same function, meaning both answers are correct.   A plot of and from Example and the Technology Note          Integrating powers of sine and cosine   Evaluate .    Video solution     The powers of sine and cosine are both even, so we employ the power-reducing formulas and algebra as follows.   The first integral labeled is easy to integrate. The term is also easy to integrate, especially with Key Idea . The term is another trigonometric integral with an even power, requiring the power-reducing formula again. The term is a cosine function with an odd power, requiring a substitution as done before. We integrate each in turn below. .  Finally, we rewrite as .  Letting , we have , hence .  Putting all the pieces together, we have .    The process above was a bit long and tedious, but being able to work a problem such as this from start to finish is important.    Integrals of the form , , and  Functions that contain products of sines and cosines of differing periods are important in many applications including the analysis of sound waves. Integrals of the form are best approached by first applying the Product to Sum Formulas found in the back cover of this text, namely .   Integrating products of and   Evaluate .    Video solution     The application of the formula and subsequent integration are straightforward:       Integrals of the form  When evaluating integrals of the form , the Pythagorean Theorem allowed us to convert even powers of sine into even powers of cosine, and vise-versa. If, for instance, the power of sine was odd, we pulled out one and converted the remaining even power of into a function using powers of , leading to an easy substitution.  The same basic strategy applies to integrals of the form , albeit a bit more nuanced. The following three facts will prove useful:    ,  ,    (the Pythagorean Theorem).     If the integrand can be manipulated to separate a term with the remaining secant power even, or if a term can be separated with the remaining power even, the Pythagorean Theorem can be employed, leading to a simple substitution. This strategy is outlined in the following Key Idea.   Integrals Involving Powers of Tangent and Secant  Consider , where are nonnegative integers. integration of trig. powers      If is even, then for some integer . Rewrite as . Then , where and .    If is odd, then for some integer . Rewrite as . Then , where and .    If is odd and is even, then for some integer . Convert to . Expand the new integrand and use Integration By Parts, with .    If is even and , rewrite as . So .      The techniques described in Item and Item of Key Idea are relatively straightforward, but the techniques in Item and Item can be rather tedious. A few examples will help with these methods.   Integrating powers of tangent and secant   Evaluate .    Video solution     Since the power of secant is even, we use Rule from Key Idea and pull out a in the integrand. We convert the remaining powers of secant into powers of tangent. .    When we have an odd power of (and to any power of at least one), we can split off a factor of and use the substitution , as the video in illustrates.   An integral with odd powers of and     Integrating powers of tangent and secant   Evaluate .    Video solution     We apply Rule from Key Idea as the power of secant is odd and the power of tangent is even ( is an even number). We use Integration by Parts; the rule suggests letting , meaning that .    Setting up Integration by Parts              Employing Integration by Parts, we have     Integrals involving odd powers of (and nothing else) are often among the more intimidating tasks for beginning calculus students. However, larger odd powers are best handled not by doing the integral directly, but by employing a reduction forumula . The video in shows how to obtain a reduction formula for the integral of ; this formula allows us to express the integral in terms of an integral where the power of is reduced by two. reduction formula trigonometric integral    Deriving a power reduction formula for secant integrals    We give one more example.    Integrating powers of tangent and secant   Evaluate .    Video solution     We employ Rule of Key Idea . .    These latter examples were admittedly long, with repeated applications of the same rule. Try to not be overwhelmed by the length of the problem, but rather admire how robust this solution method is. A trigonometric function of a high power can be systematically reduced to trigonometric functions of lower powers until all antiderivatives can be computed.

Problems    Evaluate the indefinite integral.

  "title": "Trigonometric Substitution",
  "body": " Trigonometric Substitution  In Section we defined the definite integral as the signed area under the curve. In that section we had not yet learned the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, so we only evaluated special definite integrals which described nice, geometric shapes. For instance, we were able to evaluate as we recognized that described the upper half of a circle with radius 3.  We have since learned a number of integration techniques, including Substitution and Integration by Parts, yet we are still unable to evaluate the above integral without resorting to a geometric interpretation. This section introduces Trigonometric Substitution, a method of integration that fills this gap in our integration skill. This technique works on the same principle as Substitution as found in Section , though it can feel backward. In Section , we set , for some function , and replaced with . In this section, we will set , where is a trigonometric function, then replace with .   Video introduction to    We start by demonstrating this method in evaluating the integral in . After the example, we will generalize the method and give more examples.   Using Trigonometric Substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     We begin by noting that , and hence . If we let , then .  Setting gives . We are almost ready to substitute. We also wish to change our bounds of integration. The bound corresponds to (for when , ). Likewise, the bound of is replaced by the bound . Thus . On , is always positive, so we can drop the absolute value bars, then employ a power-reducing formula: .  This matches our answer from before.    We now describe in detail Trigonometric Substitution. This method excels when dealing with integrands that contain , and . The following Key Idea outlines the procedure for each case, followed by more examples. Each right triangle acts as a reference to help us understand the relationships between and .   Trigonometric Substitution     Integrands containing    integration trig. subst. Let , . Thus , for . On this interval, , so .              Integrands containing   Let , . Thus , for . On this interval, , so .              Integrands containing   Let , . Thus . If , then ; if , then . We restrict our work to where , so , and . On this interval, , so .                  Using Trigonometric Substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     Using Item Key Idea , we recognize and set . This makes . We will use the fact that . Substituting, we have: .  While the integration steps are over, we are not yet done. The original problem was stated in terms of , whereas our answer is given in terms of . We must convert back to .  The reference triangle given in Key Idea (b) helps. With , we have .  This gives .  We can leave this answer as is, or we can use a logarithmic identity to simplify it. Note: , where the term is absorbed into the constant . (In Section we will learn another way of approaching this problem.)     Using Trigonometric Substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     We start by rewriting the integrand so that it looks like for some value of : .  So we have , and following Key Idea (c), we set , and hence . We now rewrite the integral with these substitutions: .  We integrated in Example , finding its antiderivatives to be .  Thus .  We are not yet done. Our original integral is given in terms of , whereas our final answer, as given, is in terms of . We need to rewrite our answer in terms of . With , and , the reference triangle in Key Idea (c) shows that .  Thus .  The final answer is given in the last line above, repeated here: .     Using Trigonometric Substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     We use Key Idea (a) with , , and hence . This gives .  We need to rewrite our answer in terms of . Using the reference triangle found in Key Idea (a), we have and . Thus .    Trigonometric Substitution can be applied in many situations, even those not of the form , or . In the following example, we apply it to an integral we already know how to handle.   Using Trigonometric Substitution   Evaluate .    We know the answer already as . We apply Trigonometric Substitution here to show that we get the same answer without inherently relying on knowledge of the derivative of the arctangent function.  Using Key Idea (b), let , and note that . Thus .  Since , , and we conclude that .    The next example is similar to the previous one in that it does not involve a square-root. It shows how several techniques and identities can be combined to obtain a solution.   Using Trigonometric Substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     We start by completing the square, then make the substitution , followed by the trigonometric substitution of : .  We need to return to the variable . As , . Using the identity and using the reference triangle found in Key Idea (b), we have .  Finally, we return to with the substitution . We start with the expression in Equation : .  Stating our final result in one line, .    Our last example returns us to definite integrals, as seen in our first example. Given a definite integral that can be evaluated using Trigonometric Substitution, we could first evaluate the corresponding indefinite integral (by changing from an integral in terms of to one in terms of , then converting back to ) and then evaluate using the original bounds. It is much more straightforward, though, to change the bounds as we substitute.   Definite integration and Trigonometric Substitution   Evaluate .    Video solution     Using Key Idea (b), we set , , and note that . As we substitute, we can also change the bounds of integration.  The lower bound of the original integral is . As , we solve for and find . Thus the new lower bound is . The original upper bound is , thus the new upper bound is .  Thus we have .  We encountered this indefinite integral in Example where we found .  So .    The following equalities are very useful when evaluating integrals using Trigonometric Substitution.   Useful Equalities with Trigonometric Substitution                     .      The next section introduces Partial Fraction Decomposition, which is an algebraic technique that turns complicated fractions into sums of simpler fractions, making integration easier.    Terms and Concepts     Trigonometric Substitution works on the same principles as Integration by Substitution, though it can feel .

Problems    Apply Trigonometric Substitution to evaluate the indefinite integral.                                                                                                                                                                              Evaluate the indefinite integral. It might be doable without Trigonometric Substitution.

  "title": "Partial Fraction Decomposition",
  "body": " Partial Fraction Decomposition  In this section we investigate the antiderivatives of rational functions. Recall that rational functions are functions of the form , where and are polynomials and . Such functions arise in many contexts, one of which is the solving of certain fundamental differential equations.   Video introduction to    We begin with an example that demonstrates the motivation behind this section. Consider the integral . We do not have a simple formula for this (if the denominator were , we would recognize the antiderivative as being the arctangent function). It can be solved using Trigonometric Substitution, but note how the integral is easy to evaluate once we realize: .  Thus .  This section teaches how to decompose  .  We start with a rational function , where and do not have any common factors and the degree of is less than the degree of . It can be shown that any polynomial, and hence , can be factored into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic terms. The following Key Idea states how to decompose a rational function into a sum of rational functions whose denominators are all of lower degree than .   Partial Fraction Decomposition  Let be a rational function, where the degree of is less than the degree of . integration partial fraction decomp.       Linear Terms: Let divide , where is the highest power of that divides . Then the decomposition of will contain the sum .     Quadratic Terms: Let be an irreducible quadratic that divides , where is the highest power of that divides . Then the decomposition of will contain the sum .     To find the coefficients , and :     Multiply all fractions by , clearing the denominators. Collect like terms.    Equate the resulting coefficients of the powers of and solve the resulting system of linear equations.       An irreducible quadratic is a quadratic that has no real solutions. Solving using the quadratic equation will determine if a quadratic is irreducible. Completing the square (which is a common integration technique) will also tell you if a quadratic is irreducible.   The following examples will demonstrate how to put this Key Idea into practice. Example stresses the decomposition aspect of the Key Idea.   Decomposing into partial fractions   Decompose without solving for the resulting coefficients.    Video solution     The denominator is already factored, as both and cannot be factored further. We need to decompose properly. Since is a linear term that divides the denominator, there will be a term in the decomposition.  As divides the denominator, we will have the following terms in the decomposition: .  The term in the denominator results in a term.  Finally, the term results in the terms .  All together, we have   Solving for the coefficients , would be a bit tedious but not hard.      Decomposing into partial fractions   Perform the partial fraction decomposition of .    Video solution     The denominator factors into two linear terms: . Thus .  To solve for and , first multiply through by : , by collecting like terms.  The next step is key. Note the equality we have: .  For clarity's sake, rewrite the left hand side as .  On the left, the coefficient of the term is 0; on the right, it is . Since both sides are equal, we must have that .  Likewise, on the left, we have a constant term of 1; on the right, the constant term is . Therefore we have .  We have two linear equations with two unknowns. This one is easy to solve by hand, leading to If we add these two equations, we get . Substitution into the first equation gives .  Thus .    There is another method for finding the partial fraction decomposition called the Heaviside method, named after Oliver Heaviside. We show a variation of this process using the same example as in Example .   Decomposing into partial fractions using the Heaviside method   Perform the partial fraction decomposition of .    Video solution     As we saw in Example , .  To solve for and using the Heaviside method, we will build to a common denominator:   Now since the denomiators match, we will only consider the numerator equation (essentially if we multiply both sides of the equation by , we will clear the denomiators): Now we substitute in convenient values of . When , we get . When , we get .  You may note that and were not in the domain of the original fraction. However, is an identity, meaning it is true for all values of , even those for which the equation is undefined. We could have chosen any values of to substitute. Whenever possible, we choose values of that will make one of the factors zero. In this way, we can avoid solving a system of equations.  Thus as in Example , we get .    For the remaining examples, we will use a combination of systems of equations and the Heaviside method to get partial fraction decompositions.   Integrating using partial fractions   Use partial fraction decomposition to integrate .    Video solution     We decompose the integrand as follows, as described by Key Idea : .  To solve for , and , we multiply both sides by :   Now we collect like terms:     Equation offers a direct route to finding the values of , and . Since the equation holds for all values of , it holds in particular when . However, when , the right hand side simplifies to . Since the left hand side is still 1, we have . Hence .  Likewise, the equality holds when ; this leads to the equation . Thus .  Knowing and , we can find the value of by choosing yet another value of , such as , and solving for .   We have leading to the equations .  These three equations of three unknowns lead to a unique solution: .  Thus .  Each can be integrated with a simple substitution with or (or by directly applying Key Idea as the denominators are linear functions). The end result is .    In examples like where there are repeated roots, there is an extension of the Heaviside method using derivatives. This method is explained in below.   Alternate method for finding coefficients in     Integrating using partial fractions   Use partial fraction decomposition to integrate .    Video solution      Key Idea presumes that the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Since this is not the case here, we begin by using polynomial division to reduce the degree of the numerator. We omit the steps, but encourage the reader to verify that .  Using Key Idea , we can rewrite the new rational function as: for appropriate values of and . Clearing denominators, we have   The values of and can be quickly found using the technique described in Example , or they can be found by equating coefficients, as we do in Example .    .  We can now integrate. .     Integrating using partial fractions   Use partial fraction decomposition to evaluate .    Video solution     The degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator so we begin by applying Key Idea . We have:  Now, letting we have . When , . But we know that , so Finally, we choose (with ) we have .   Thus .  The first term of this new integrand is easy to evaluate; it leads to a term. The second term is not hard, but takes several steps and uses substitution techniques.  The integrand has a quadratic in the denominator and a linear term in the numerator. This leads us to try substitution. Let , so . The numerator is , not , but we can get a term in the numerator by adding 0 in the form of .  .  We can now integrate the first term with substitution, leading to a term. The final term can be integrated using arctangent. (We can tell there is no further factoring for this quadratic since the denominator has no real solutions). First, complete the square in the denominator: .  An antiderivative of the latter term can be found using Theorem and substitution: .  Let's start at the beginning and put all of the steps together. .  As with many other problems in calculus, it is important to remember that one is not expected to see the final answer immediately after seeing the problem. Rather, given the initial problem, we break it down into smaller problems that are easier to solve. The final answer is a combination of the answers of the smaller problems.    Partial Fraction Decomposition is an important tool when dealing with rational functions. Note that at its heart, it is a technique of algebra, not calculus, as we are rewriting a fraction in a new form. Regardless, it is very useful in the realm of calculus as it lets us evaluate a certain set of complicated integrals.   Section introduces new functions, called the Hyperbolic Functions. They will allow us to make substitutions similar to those found when studying Trigonometric Substitution, allowing us to approach even more integration problems.    Terms and Concepts    Partial Fraction Decomposition is a method of rewriting functions.                 ?

Among many other applications, they are used to describe the formation of satellite rings around planets, to describe the shape of a rope hanging from two points, and have application to the theory of special relativity. This section defines the hyperbolic functions and describes many of their properties, especially their usefulness to calculus.  These functions are sometimes referred to as the hyperbolic trigonometric functions as there are many, many connections between them and the standard trigonometric functions. Figure demonstrates one such connection. Just as cosine and sine are used to define points on the circle defined by , the functions hyperbolic cosine and hyperbolic sine are used to define points on the hyperbola .

Using another Basic Identity, we can see that . We get the same answer either way.    We employ substitution, with and . Applying Key Ideas and we have: .     . We can simplify this last expression as is based on exponentials: .         Inverse Hyperbolic Functions  Just as the inverse trigonometric functions are useful in certain applications, the inverse hyperbolic functions are useful with others. Figure shows restriction on the domain of to make the function one-to-one and the resulting domain and range of its inverse function. Since is already one-to-one, no domain restriction is needed as shown in Figure . Since is not one to one, it also needs a restricted domain in order to be invertible. Figure shows the graph of . You should carefully compare the graph of this function to the graph given in Figure to see how this inverse was constructed. The rest of the hyperbolic functions area already one-to-one and need no domain restrictions. Their graphs are also shown in Figure . hyperbolic function inverse   Because the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions, their inverses can be expressed in terms of logarithms as shown in Key Idea . It is often more convenient to refer to than to , especially when one is working on theory and does not need to compute actual values. On the other hand, when computations are needed, technology is often helpful but many hand-held calculators lack a convenient  button. (Often it can be accessed under a menu system, but not conveniently.) In such a situation, the logarithmic representation is useful. The reader is not encouraged to memorize these, but rather know they exist and know how to use them when needed.

This requires a substitution, then item #2 of Key Idea can be applied. Let , hence . We have .       This section covers a lot of ground. New functions were introduced, along with some of their fundamental identities, their derivatives and antiderivatives, their inverses, and the derivatives and antiderivatives of these inverses. Four Key Ideas were presented, each including quite a bit of information.  Do not view this section as containing a source of information to be memorized, but rather as a reference for future problem solving. Key Idea contains perhaps the most useful information. Know the integration forms it helps evaluate and understand how to use the inverse hyperbolic answer and the logarithmic answer.  The next section takes a brief break from demonstrating new integration techniques. It instead demonstrates a technique of evaluating limits that return indeterminate forms. This technique will be useful in Section , where limits will arise in the evaluation of certain definite integrals.     Terms and Concepts     In Key Idea 6.6.8, the equation is given.

The hyperbolic functions are used to define points on the right hand portion of the hyperbola as shown in Figure 6.6.2. How can we use the hyperbolic functions to define points on the left hand portion of the hyperbola?   The points on the left hand side can be defined as         Problems    In the following exercises, verify the given identity using Definition , as done in Example .

  "title": "L'Hospital's Rule",
  "body": " L'Hospital's Rule   While this chapter is devoted to learning techniques of integration, this section is not about integration. Rather, it is concerned with a technique of evaluating certain limits that will be useful in the following section, where integration is once more discussed.  Our treatment of limits exposed us to the notion of 0\/0 , an indeterminate form. If and , we do not conclude that is ; rather, we use as notation to describe the fact that both the numerator and denominator approach 0. The expression 0\/0 has no numeric value; other work must be done to evaluate the limit.  Other indeterminate forms exist; they are: , , , , and . Just as 0\/0 does not mean divide 0 by 0, the expression does not mean divide infinity by infinity. Instead, it means a quantity is growing without bound and is being divided by another quantity that is growing without bound. We cannot determine from such a statement what value, if any, results in the limit. Likewise, does not mean multiply zero by infinity. Instead, it means one quantity is shrinking to zero, and is being multiplied by a quantity that is growing without bound. We cannot determine from such a description what the result of such a limit will be.   Video introduction to    This section introduces l'Hospital's Rule, a method of resolving limits that produce the indeterminate forms 0\/0 and . We'll also show how algebraic manipulation can be used to convert other indeterminate expressions into one of these two forms so that our new rule can be applied.    L'Hospital's Rule with indeterminate forms and   L'Hospital's Rule, Part 1   Let and , where and are differentiable functions on an open interval containing , and on except possibly at . If limit l'Hospital's Rule  l'Hospital's Rule zero over zero  , then , where is a real number, or . The result applies to one-sided limits as well.     To use in practice, notice that there are two conditions we need to check. First, the original limit needs to be of the form. Second, the new limit (involving the derivatives of and ) must exist (or be infinite).  In some cases, the new limit will also be , in which case we can apply l'Hospital's rule again. The rule can be applied repeatedly (taking additional derivatives), as long as we reach a step where the limit exists.   We demonstrate the use of l'Hospital's Rule in the following examples; we will often use LHR as an abbreviation of l'Hospital's Rule.    Using l'Hospital's Rule   Evaluate the following limits, using l'Hospital's Rule as needed.                    Video solution        We proved this limit is 1 in Example using the Squeeze Theorem. Here we use l'Hospital's Rule to show its power. .    .    . This latter limit also evaluates to the 0\/0 indeterminate form. To evaluate it, we apply l'Hospital's Rule again. . Thus .    We already know how to evaluate this limit; first factor the numerator and denominator. We then have: . We now show how to solve this using l'Hospital's Rule. .       Note that at each step where l'Hospital's Rule was applied, it was needed : the initial limit returned the indeterminate form of . If the initial limit returns, for example, 1\/2, then l'Hospital's Rule does not apply.  The following theorem extends our initial version of l'Hospital's Rule in two ways. It allows the technique to be applied to the indeterminate form and to limits where approaches .   L'Hospital's Rule, Part 2      Let and , where and are differentiable on an open interval containing . If limit l'Hospital's Rule  l'Hospital's Rule infinity over infinity  , then , where is a real number, or . The result applies to one-sided limits as well.    Let and be differentiable functions on the open interval for some value , where on and returns either or . If , then , where is a real number, or . A similar statement can be made for limits where approaches .        Using l'Hospital's Rule with limits involving   Evaluate the following limits.   .    Video solution        We can evaluate this limit already using Theorem ; the answer is 3\/4. We apply l'Hospital's Rule to demonstrate its applicability. .     . Recall that this means that the limit does not exist; as approaches , the expression grows without bound. We can infer from this that grows faster than ; as gets large, is far larger than . (This has important implications in computing when considering efficiency of algorithms.)         Indeterminate Forms and  L'Hospital's Rule can only be applied to ratios of functions. When faced with an indeterminate form such as or , we can sometimes apply algebra to rewrite the limit so that l'Hospital's Rule can be applied. We demonstrate the general idea in the next example. limit indeterminate form  indeterminate form    Applying l'Hospital's Rule to other indeterminate forms   Evaluate the following limits.            Video solution        As , and . Thus we have the indeterminate form . We rewrite the expression as ; now, as , we get the indeterminate form to which l'Hospital's Rule can be applied. . Interpretation: grows faster than shrinks to zero, meaning their product grows without bound.    As , and . The the limit evaluates to which is not an indeterminate form. We conclude then that .    This limit initially evaluates to the indeterminate form . By applying a logarithmic rule, we can rewrite the limit as . As , the argument of the term approaches , to which we can apply l'Hospital's Rule. . Since implies , it follows that . Thus . Interpretation: since this limit evaluates to 0, it means that for large , there is essentially no difference between and ; their difference is essentially 0.    The limit initially returns the indeterminate form . We can rewrite the expression by factoring out ; . We need to evaluate how behaves as : . Thus evaluates to , which is not an indeterminate form; rather, evaluates to . We conclude that . Interpretation: as gets large, the difference between and grows very large.         Indeterminate Forms  , and  When faced with an indeterminate form that involves a power, it often helps to employ the natural logarithmic function. The following Key Idea expresses the concept, which is followed by an example that demonstrates its use.   Evaluating Limits Involving Indeterminate Forms , and  If , then . limit indeterminate form  indeterminate form     Using l'Hospital's Rule with indeterminate forms involving exponents   Evaluate the following limits.          Video solution        This is equivalent to a special limit given in Theorem ; these limits have important applications within mathematics and finance. Note that the exponent approaches while the base approaches 1, leading to the indeterminate form . Let ; the problem asks to evaluate . Let's first evaluate . . Thus . We return to the original limit and apply Key Idea . .    This limit leads to the indeterminate form . Let and consider first . . Thus . We return to the original limit and apply Key Idea . . This result is supported by the graph of given in Figure .   A graph of supporting the fact that as ,              Our brief revisit of limits will be rewarded in the next section where we consider improper integration. So far, we have only considered definite integrals where the bounds are finite numbers, such as . Improper integration considers integrals where one, or both, of the bounds are infinity. Such integrals have many uses and applications, in addition to generating ideas that are enlightening.

  "body": " Improper Integration   We begin this section by considering the following definite integrals:         Notice how the integrand is in each integral (which is sketched in Figure ). As the upper bound gets larger, one would expect the area under the curve would also grow. While the definite integrals do increase in value as the upper bound grows, they are not increasing by much. In fact, consider: .  As , . Therefore it seems that as the upper bound grows, the value of the definite integral approaches . This should strike the reader as being a bit amazing: even though the curve extends to infinity, it has a finite amount of area underneath it.   Graphing          Video introduction to    When we defined the definite integral , we made two stipulations:     The interval over which we integrated, , was a finite interval, and    The function was continuous on (ensuring that the range of was finite).     In this section we consider integrals where one or both of the above conditions do not hold. Such integrals are called improper integrals.     Improper Integrals with Infinite Bounds   Improper Integrals with Infinite Bounds; Converge, Diverge      Let be a continuous function on . Define integration improper  improper integration  convergence of improper int.  divergence of improper int.  .    Let be a continuous function on . Define .    Let be a continuous function on . Let be any real number; define .     An improper integral is said to converge if its corresponding limit exists; otherwise, it diverges . The improper integral in part 3 converges if and only if both of its limits exist.     Evaluating improper integrals   Evaluate the following improper integrals.            Video solution         . A graph of the area defined by this integral is given in Figure .   A graph of in Example            . The limit does not exist, hence the improper integral diverges. Compare the graphs in Figures and ; notice how the graph of is noticeably larger. This difference is enough to cause the improper integral to diverge.   A graph of in Example            . A graph of the area defined by this integral is given in Figure .   A graph of in Example           We will need to break this into two improper integrals and choose a value of as in part 3 of Definition . Any value of is fine; we choose . . A graph of the area defined by this integral is given in Figure .   A graph of in Example              The previous section introduced L'Hospital's Rule, a method of evaluating limits that return indeterminate forms. It is not uncommon for the limits resulting from improper integrals to need this rule as demonstrated next.   Improper integration and L'Hospital's Rule   Evaluate the improper integral .    Video solution     This integral will require the use of Integration by Parts. Let and . Then   A graph of in Example          .      Improper Integrals with Infinite Range  We have just considered definite integrals where the interval of integration was infinite. We now consider another type of improper integration, where the range of the integrand is infinite.   Improper Integration with Infinite Range   Let be a continuous function on except at , , where is a vertical asymptote of . Define integration improper  improper integration  .     Improper integration of functions with infinite range   Evaluate the following improper integrals:          Video solution        A graph of is given in Figure . Notice that has a vertical asymptote at ; in some sense, we are trying to compute the area of a region that has no top. Could this have a finite value? . It turns out that the region does have a finite area even though it has no upper bound (strange things can occur in mathematics when considering the infinite).   In Definition , can be one of the endpoints ( or ). In that case, there is only one limit to consider as part of the definition.    A graph of in Example           The function has a vertical asymptote at , as shown in Figure , so this integral is an improper integral. Let's eschew using limits for a moment and proceed without recognizing the improper nature of the integral. This leads to:    A graph of in Example         Clearly the area in question is above the -axis, yet the area is supposedly negative! Why does our answer not match our intuition? To answer this, evaluate the integral using Definition . . Neither limit converges hence the original improper integral diverges. The nonsensical answer we obtained by ignoring the improper nature of the integral is just that: nonsensical.         Understanding Convergence and Divergence  Oftentimes we are interested in knowing simply whether or not an improper integral converges, and not necessarily the value of a convergent integral. We provide here several tools that help determine the convergence or divergence of improper integrals without integrating.  Our first tool is to understand the behavior of functions of the form .   Improper integration of   Determine the values of for which converges.    Video solution     We begin by integrating and then evaluating the limit. .  When does this limit converge  , when is this limit not  ? This limit converges precisely when the power of is less than 0: when .   Plotting functions of the form in Example         Our analysis shows that if , then converges. When the improper integral diverges; we showed in Example that when the integral also diverges.   Figure graphs with a dashed line, along with graphs of , , and , . Somehow the dashed line forms a dividing line between convergence and divergence.    The result of Example provides an important tool in determining the convergence of other integrals. A similar result is proved in the exercises about improper integrals of the form . These results are summarized in the following Key Idea.   Convergence of Improper Integrals involving     The improper integral converges when and diverges when . convergence of improper int.  divergence of improper int.     The improper integral converges when and diverges when .      A basic technique in determining convergence of improper integrals is to compare an integrand whose convergence is unknown to an integrand whose convergence is known. We often use integrands of the form to compare to as their convergence on certain intervals is known. This is described in the following theorem.   We used the upper and lower bound of 1 in Key Idea for convenience. It can be replaced by any where .    Direct Comparison Test for Improper Integrals   Let and be continuous on where for all in .     If converges, then converges. integration improper  convergence Direct Comparison Test!for integration  divergence Direct Comparison Test!for integration  Direct Comparison Test for integration  convergence of improper int.  divergence of improper int.     If diverges, then diverges.        Determining convergence of improper integrals   Determine the convergence of the following improper integrals.          Video solution        The function does not have an antiderivative expressible in terms of elementary functions, so we cannot integrate directly. It is comparable to , and as demonstrated in Figure , on . We know from Key Idea that converges, hence also converges.   Graphs of and in Example           Note that for large values of , . We know from Key Idea and the subsequent note that diverges, so we seek to compare the original integrand to . It is easy to see that when , we have . Taking reciprocals reverses the inequality, giving . Using Theorem , we conclude that since diverges, diverges as well. Figure illustrates this.   Graphs of and in Example              Being able to compare unknown integrals to known integrals is very useful in determining convergence. However, some of our examples were a little too nice. For instance, it was convenient that , but what if the were replaced with a ? That is, what can we say about the convergence of ? We have , so we cannot use Theorem .  In cases like this (and many more) it is useful to employ the following theorem.   Limit Comparison Test for Improper Integrals   Let and be continuous functions on where and for all . If , then either both converge or both diverge. integration improper  convergence Limit Comparison Test!for integration  divergence Limit Comparison Test!for integration  Limit Comparison Test for integration  convergence of improper int.  divergence of improper int.      Determining convergence of improper integrals   Determine the convergence of .    Video solution     As gets large, the denominator of the integrand will begin to behave much like . So we compare to with the Limit Comparison Test: .  The immediate evaluation of this limit returns , an indeterminate form. Using L'Hospital's Rule seems appropriate, but in this situation, it does not lead to useful results. (We encourage the reader to employ L'Hospital's Rule at least once to verify this.)  The trouble is the square root function. To get rid of it, we employ the following fact: If , then . (This is true when either or is .) So we consider now the limit .  This converges to 1, meaning the original limit also converged to 1. As gets very large, the function looks very much like .\\ Since we know that diverges, by the Limit Comparison Test we know that also diverges. Figure graphs and , illustrating that as gets large, the functions become indistinguishable.   Graphing and in Example           Both the Direct and Limit Comparison Tests were given in terms of integrals over an infinite interval. There are versions that apply to improper integrals with an infinite range, but as they are a bit wordy and a little more difficult to employ, they are omitted from this text.  This chapter has explored many integration techniques. We learned Substitution, which undoes the Chain Rule of differentiation, as well as Integration by Parts, which undoes the Product Rule. We learned specialized techniques for handling trigonometric functions and introduced the hyperbolic functions, which are closely related to the trigonometric functions. All techniques effectively have this goal in common: rewrite the integrand in a new way so that the integration step is easier to see and implement.  As stated before, integration is, in general, hard. It is easy to write a function whose antiderivative is impossible to write in terms of elementary functions, and even when a function does have an antiderivative expressible by elementary functions, it may be really hard to discover what it is. The powerful computer algebra system Mathematica has approximately 1,000 pages of code dedicated to integration.  Do not let this difficulty discourage you. There is great value in learning integration techniques, as they allow one to manipulate an integral in ways that can illuminate a concept for greater understanding. There is also great value in understanding the need for good numerical techniques: the Trapezoidal and Simpson's Rules are just the beginning of powerful techniques for approximating the value of integration.  The next chapter stresses the uses of integration. We generally do not find antiderivatives for antiderivative's sake, but rather because they provide the solution to some type of problem. The following chapter introduces us to a number of different problems whose solution is provided by integration.     Terms and Concepts    The definite integral was defined with what two stipulations?   The interval of integration is finite, and the integrand is continuous on that interval.          If exists, then the integral is said to .   converge          If and for all then we know that .   converges; could also state         For what values of will converge?                                   For what values of will converge?                                   For what values of will converge?                                   Problems    In the following exercises, evaluate the given improper integral.

Forget momentarily that we addressed this already in Section and approach it instead using the technique described in Key Idea .   Video introduction to Section    Let be the area of a region bounded by continuous functions and . If we break the region into many subregions, we have an obvious equation:  Total Area = sum of the areas of the subregions.  The issue to address next is how to systematically break a region into subregions. A graph will help. Consider Figure where a region between two curves is shaded. While there are many ways to break this into subregions, one particularly efficient way is to slice it vertically, as shown in Figure , into equally spaced slices.  We now approximate the area of a slice. Again, we have many options, but using a rectangle seems simplest. Picking any -value in the th slice, we set the height of the rectangle to be , the difference of the corresponding -values. The width of the rectangle is a small difference in -values, which we represent with . Figure shows sample points chosen in each subinterval and appropriate rectangles drawn. (Each of these rectangles represents a differential element.) Each slice has an area approximately equal to ; hence, the total area is approximately the Riemann Sum .  Taking the limit as gives the exact area as .

One can proceed thoughtlessly by computing , but this ignores the fact that on , . (In fact, the thoughtless integration returns , hardly the expected value of an area .) Thus we compute the total area by breaking the interval into two subintervals, and and using the proper integrand in each. .    The previous example makes note that we are expecting area to be positive . When first learning about the definite integral, we interpreted it as signed area under the curve, allowing for negative area. That doesn't apply here; area is to be positive.  The previous example also demonstrates that we often have to break a given region into subregions before applying Theorem . The following example shows another situation where this is applicable, along with an alternate view of applying the Theorem.   Finding area: integrating with respect to   Find the area of the region enclosed by the functions , and , as shown in Figure .   Graphing a region for Example           Video solution     We give two approaches to this problem. In the first approach, we notice that the region's top is defined by two different curves. On , the top function is ; on , the top function is .  Thus we compute the area as the sum of two integrals: .  The second approach is clever and very useful in certain situations. We are used to viewing curves as functions of ; we input an -value and a -value is returned. Some curves can also be described as functions of : input a -value and an -value is returned. We can rewrite the equations describing the boundary by solving for :  .   The region used in Example with boundaries relabeled as functions of          Figure shows the region with the boundaries relabeled. A differential element, a horizontal rectangle, is also pictured. The width of the rectangle is a small change in : . The height of the rectangle is a difference in -values. The top  -value is the largest value, , the rightmost. The bottom  -value is the smaller, , the leftmost. Therefore the height of the rectangle is .  The area is found by integrating the above function with respect to with the appropriate bounds. We determine these by considering the -values the region occupies. It is bounded below by , and bounded above by . That is, both the top and bottom functions exist on the interval . Thus .    This calculus-based technique of finding area can be useful even with shapes that we normally think of as easy.  Example computes the area of a triangle. While the formula is well known, in arbitrary triangles it can be nontrivial to compute the height. Calculus makes the problem simple.   Finding the area of a triangle   Compute the area of the regions bounded by the lines   , and , as shown in Figure .   Graphing a triangular region in Example           Video solution     Recognize that there are two top functions to this region, causing us to use two definite integrals. .  We can also approach this by converting each function into a function of . This also requires 2 integrals, so there isn't really any advantage to doing so. We do it here for demonstration purposes.  The top function is always while there are two bottom functions. Being mindful of the proper integration bounds, we have .  Of course, the final answer is the same. (It is interesting to note that the area of all 4 subregions used is 3\/4. This is coincidental.)    While we have focused on producing exact answers, we are also able to make approximations using the principle of Theorem . The integrand in the theorem is a distance ( top minus bottom ); integrating this distance function gives an area. By taking discrete measurements of distance, we can approximate an area using numerical integration techniques developed in Section . The following example demonstrates this.   Numerically approximating area   To approximate the area of a lake, shown in Figure , the length of the lake is measured at 200-foot increments, as shown in Figure . The lengths are given in hundreds of feet. Approximate the area of the lake.   (a) A sketch of a lake, and (b) the lake with length measurements                         The measurements of length can be viewed as measuring top minus bottom of two functions. The exact answer is found by integrating , but of course we don't know the functions and . Our discrete measurements instead allow us to approximate.  We have the following data points: .  We also have that , so Simpson's Rule gives .  Since the measurements are in hundreds of feet, square units are given by ( 100 ) 10,000 , giving a total area of 440,133 . (Since we are approximating, we'd likely say the area was about 440,000 , which is a little more than 10 acres.)    In the next section we apply our applications of integration techniques to finding the volumes of certain solids.    Terms and Concepts    The area between curves is always positive.   ?

The volume of a general right cylinder         We can use this fact as the building block in finding volumes of a variety of shapes.   Video introduction to Section    Given an arbitrary solid, we can approximate its volume by cutting it into thin slices. When the slices are thin, each slice can be approximated well by a general right cylinder. Thus the volume of each slice is approximately its cross-sectional area thickness. (These slices are the differential elements.)  By orienting a solid along the -axis, we can let represent the cross-sectional area of the th slice, and let represent the thickness of this slice (the thickness is a small change in ). The total volume of the solid is approximately: .  Recognize that this is a Riemann Sum. By taking a limit (as the thickness of the slices goes to 0) we can find the volume exactly.   Volume By Cross-Sectional Area   The volume of a solid, oriented along the -axis with cross-sectional area from to , is integration volume!cross-sectional area  .     Finding the volume of a solid   Find the volume of a pyramid with a square base of side length 10 and a height of 5 .    Video solution     There are many ways to orient the pyramid along the -axis; Figure gives one such way, with the pointed top of the pyramid at the origin and the -axis going through the center of the base.   Orienting a pyramid along the -axis in Example         Each cross section of the pyramid is a square; this is a sample differential element. To determine its area , we need to determine the side lengths of the square.  When , the square has side length 10; when , the square has side length 0. Since the edges of the pyramid are lines, it is easy to figure that each cross-sectional square has side length , giving .  If one were to cut a slice out of the pyramid at , as shown in Figure , one would have a shape with square bottom and top with sloped sides. If the slice were thin, both the bottom and top squares would have sides lengths of about 6, and thus the cross-sectional area of the bottom and top would be about 36 . Letting represent the thickness of the slice, the volume of this slice would then be about  .   Cutting a slice in the pyramid in Example at         Cutting the pyramid into slices divides the total volume into equally-spaced smaller pieces, each with volume , where is the approximate location of the slice along the -axis and represents the thickness of each slice. One can approximate total volume of the pyramid by summing up the volumes of these slices: .  Taking the limit as gives the actual volume of the pyramid; recoginizing this sum as a Riemann Sum allows us to find the exact answer using a definite integral, matching the definite integral given by Theorem .  We have .  We can check our work by consulting the general equation for the volume of a pyramid (see the back cover under Volume of A General Cone ):   .  Certainly, using this formula from geometry is faster than our new method, but the calculus-based method can be applied to much more than just cones.    An important special case of Theorem is when the solid is a solid of revolution , that is, when the solid is formed by rotating a shape around an axis.  Start with a function from to . Revolving this curve about a horizontal axis creates a three-dimensional solid whose cross sections are disks (thin circles). Let represent the radius of the cross-sectional disk at ; the area of this disk is . Applying Theorem gives the Disk Method.   The Disk Method  Let a solid be formed by revolving the curve from to around a horizontal axis, and let be the radius of the cross-sectional disk at . The volume of the solid is integration volume!Disk Method  Disk Method  .    Finding volume using the Disk Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the curve , from to , around the -axis.    Video solution     A sketch can help us understand this problem. In Figure , the curve is sketched along with the differential element a disk at with radius . In Figure the whole solid is pictured, along with the differential element.  The volume of the differential element shown in Figure is approximately , where is the radius of the disk shown and is the thickness of that slice. The radius is the distance from the -axis to the curve, hence .   Sketching a solid in Example                       Slicing the solid into equally-spaced slices, we can approximate the total volume by adding up the approximate volume of each slice: .  Taking the limit of the above sum as gives the actual volume; recognizing this sum as a Riemann sum allows us to evaluate the limit with a definite integral, which matches the formula given in Key Idea :  .    While Key Idea is given in terms of functions of , the principle involved can be applied to functions of when the axis of rotation is vertical, not horizontal. We demonstrate this in the next example.   Finding volume using the Disk Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the curve , from to , about the -axis.    Video solution     Since the axis of rotation is vertical, we need to convert the function into a function of and convert the -bounds to -bounds. Since defines the curve, we rewrite it as . The bound corresponds to the -bound , and the bound corresponds to the -bound .  Thus we are rotating the curve , from to about the -axis to form a solid. The curve and sample differential element are sketched in Figure , with a full sketch of the solid in Figure .   Sketching a solid in Example                       We integrate to find the volume: .    We can also compute the volume of solids of revolution that have a hole in the center. The general principle is simple: compute the volume of the solid irrespective of the hole, then subtract the volume of the hole. If the outside radius of the solid is and the inside radius (defining the hole) is , then the volume is .   Establishing the Washer Method; see also Figure                       One can generate a solid of revolution with a hole in the middle by revolving a region about an axis. Consider Figure , where a region is sketched along with a dashed, horizontal axis of rotation. By rotating the region about the axis, a solid is formed as sketched in Figure . The outside of the solid has radius , whereas the inside has radius . Each cross section of this solid will be a washer (a disk with a hole in the center) as sketched in Figure . This leads us to the Washer Method.   Establishing the Washer Method; see also Figure          The Washer Method  Let a region bounded by , , and be rotated about a horizontal axis that does not intersect the region, forming a solid. Each cross section at will be a washer with outside radius and inside radius . The volume of the solid is integration volume!Washer Method  Washer Method  .   Even though we introduced it first, the Disk Method is just a special case of the Washer Method with an inside radius of .   Finding volume with the Washer Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by and about the -axis.    Video solution     A sketch of the region will help, as given in Figure . Rotating about the -axis will produce cross sections in the shape of washers, as shown in Figure ; the complete solid is shown in Figure . The outside radius of this washer is ; the inside radius is . As the region is bounded from to , we integrate as follows to compute the volume. .   Sketching the differential element and solid in Example                                  When rotating about a vertical axis, the outside and inside radius functions must be functions of .   Finding volume with the Washer Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the triangular region with vertices at , and about the -axis.    Video solution     The triangular region is sketched in Figure ; the differential element is sketched in Figure and the full solid is drawn in Figure . They help us establish the outside and inside radii. Since the axis of rotation is vertical, each radius is a function of .  The outside radius is formed by the line connecting and ; it is a constant function, as regardless of the -value the distance from the line to the axis of rotation is 2. Thus .   Sketching the solid in Example                                The inside radius is formed by the line connecting and . The equation of this line is , but we need to refer to it as a function of . Solving for gives .  We integrate over the -bounds of to . Thus the volume is .    This section introduced a new application of the definite integral. Our default view of the definite integral is that it gives the area under the curve. However, we can establish definite integrals that represent other quantities; in this section, we computed volume.  The ultimate goal of this section is not to compute volumes of solids. That can be useful, but what is more useful is the understanding of this basic principle of integral calculus, outlined in Key Idea : to find the exact value of some quantity,     we start with an approximation (in this section, slice the solid and approximate the volume of each slice),    then make the approximation better by refining our original approximation ( , use more slices),    then use limits to establish a definite integral which gives the exact value.     We practice this principle in the next section where we find volumes by slicing solids in a different way.

  "title": "The Shell Method",
  "body": " The Shell Method  Often a given problem can be solved in more than one way. A particular method may be chosen out of convenience, personal preference, or perhaps necessity. Ultimately, it is good to have options.  The previous section introduced the Disk and Washer Methods, which computed the volume of solids of revolution by integrating the cross-sectional area of the solid. This section develops another method of computing volume, the Shell Method. Instead of slicing the solid perpendicular to the axis of rotation creating cross-sections, we now slice it parallel to the axis of rotation, creating shells.    Video introduction to Section    Consider Figure , where the region shown in Figure is rotated around the -axis forming the solid shown in Figure . A small slice of the region is drawn in Figure , parallel to the axis of rotation. When the region is rotated, this thin slice forms a cylindrical shell , as pictured in Figure . The previous section approximated a solid with lots of thin disks (or washers); we now approximate a solid with many thin cylindrical shells.   Introducing the Shell Method                                To compute the volume of one shell, first consider the paper label on a soup can with radius and height . What is the area of this label? A simple way of determining this is to cut the label and lay it out flat, forming a rectangle with height and length . Thus the area is ; see Figure .  Do a similar process with a cylindrical shell, with height , thickness , and approximate radius . Cutting the shell and laying it flat forms a rectangular solid with length , height and depth . Thus the volume is ; see Figure . (We say approximately since our radius was an approximation.)  By breaking the solid into cylindrical shells, we can approximate the volume of the solid as , where , and are the radius, height and thickness of the th shell, respectively.  This is a Riemann Sum. Taking a limit as the thickness of the shells approaches 0 leads to a definite integral.   Determining the volume of a thin cylindrical shell                       The Shell Method  Let a solid be formed by revolving a region , bounded by and , around a vertical axis. Let represent the distance from the axis of rotation to ( , the radius of a sample shell) and let represent the height of the solid at ( , the height of the shell). The volume of the solid is integration volume!Shell Method  Shell Method  .    Special Cases:      When the region is bounded above by and below by , then .    When the axis of rotation is the -axis ( , ) then .     Let's practice using the Shell Method.   Finding volume using the Shell Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by , , and about the -axis.    Video solution     This is the region used to introduce the Shell Method in Figure , but is sketched again in Figure for closer reference. A line is drawn in the region parallel to the axis of rotation representing a shell that will be carved out as the region is rotated about the -axis. (This is the differential element.)   Graphing a region in Example         The distance this line is from the axis of rotation determines ; as the distance from to the -axis is , we have . The height of this line determines ; the top of the line is at , whereas the bottom of the line is at . Thus . The region is bounded from to , so the volume is .  Note: in order to find this volume using the Disk Method, two integrals would be needed to account for the regions above and below .    With the Shell Method, nothing special needs to be accounted for to compute the volume of a solid that has a hole in the middle, as demonstrated next.   Finding volume using the Shell Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the triangular region determined by the points , and about the line .    Video solution     The region is sketched in Figure along with the differential element, a line within the region parallel to the axis of rotation. In Figure , we see the shell traced out by the differential element, and in Figure the whole solid is shown.   Graphing a region in Example                              The height of the differential element is the distance from to , the line that connects the points and . Thus . The radius of the shell formed by the differential element is the distance from to ; that is, it is . The -bounds of the region are to , giving .    When revolving a region around a horizontal axis, we must consider the radius and height functions in terms of , not .   Finding volume using the Shell Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region given in Example about the -axis.    Video solution     The region is sketched in Figure with a sample differential element. In Figure the shell formed by the differential element is drawn, and the solid is sketched in Figure . (Note that the triangular region looks short and wide here, whereas in the previous example the same region looked tall and narrow. This is because the bounds on the graphs are different.)  The height of the differential element is an -distance, between and . Thus . The radius is the distance from to the -axis, so . The bounds of the region are and , leading to the integral   Graphing a region in Example                                 .    At the beginning of this section it was stated that it is good to have options. The next example finds the volume of a solid rather easily with the Shell Method, but using the Washer Method would be quite a chore.   Finding volume using the Shell Method   Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by and the -axis from to about the -axis.    Video solution     The region and a differential element, the shell formed by this differential element, and the resulting solid are given in Figure .   Graphing a region in Example                                The radius of a sample shell is ; the height of a sample shell is , each from to . Thus the volume of the solid is .  Note that in order to use the Washer Method, we would need to solve for , requiring the use of the arcsine function. We leave it to the reader to verify that the outside radius function is and the inside radius function is . Thus the volume can be computed as .  This integral isn't terrible given that the terms cancel, but it is more onerous than the integral created by the Shell Method.    We end this section with a table summarizing the usage of the Washer and Shell Methods.   Summary of the Washer and Shell Methods  Let a region be given with -bounds and and -bounds and .     Washer Method   Shell Method    Horizontal Axis          Vertical Axis        integration volume!Washer Method  Washer Method  integration volume!Shell Method  Shell Method    As in the previous section, the real goal of this section is not to be able to compute volumes of certain solids. Rather, it is to be able to solve a problem by first approximating, then using limits to refine the approximation to give the exact value. In this section, we approximate the volume of a solid by cutting it into thin cylindrical shells. By summing up the volumes of each shell, we get an approximation of the volume. By taking a limit as the number of equally spaced shells goes to infinity, our summation can be evaluated as a definite integral, giving the exact value.  We use this same principle again in the next section, where we find the length of curves in the plane.

  "body": " Arc Length and Surface Area   In previous sections we have used integration to answer the following questions:     Given a region, what is its area?    Given a solid, what is its volume?      Video introduction to    In this section, we address two related questions:   Given a curve, what is its length? This is often referred to as arc length .    Given a solid, what is its surface area?        Arc Length  Consider the graph of on given in Figure . How long is this curve? That is, if we were to use a piece of string to exactly match the shape of this curve, how long would the string be?  As we have done in the past, we start by approximating; later, we will refine our answer using limits to get an exact solution.  The length of straight-line segments is easy to compute using the Distance Formula. We can approximate the length of the given curve by approximating the curve with straight lines and measuring their lengths.   Graphing on and approximating the curve with line segments                       In Figure , the curve has been approximated with 4 line segments (the interval has been divided into 4 subintervals of equal length). It is clear that these four line segments approximate very well on the first and last subinterval, though not so well in the middle. Regardless, the sum of the lengths of the line segments is , so we approximate the arc length of on to be .  In general, we can approximate the arc length of on in the following manner. Let be a partition of into subintervals. Let represent the length of the th subinterval .   Zooming in on the th subinterval ] of a partition of          Figure zooms in on the th subinterval where is approximated by a straight line segment. The dashed lines show that we can view this line segment as the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides have length and . Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of this line segment is . Summing over all subintervals gives an arc length approximation .  As shown here, this is not a Riemann Sum. While we could conclude that taking a limit as the subinterval length goes to zero gives the exact arc length, we would not be able to compute the answer with a definite integral. We need first to do a little algebra.  In the above expression factor out a term: .   Arc Length   Let be differentiable on , where is also continuous on . Then the arc length of from to is integration arc length  arc length  .      Note: This is our first use of differentiability on a closed interval since Section .  The theorem also requires that be continuous on ; while examples are arcane, it is possible for to be differentiable yet is not continuous.   As the integrand contains a square root, it is often difficult to use the formula in Theorem to find the length exactly. When exact answers are difficult to come by, we resort to using numerical methods of approximating definite integrals. The following examples will demonstrate this.   Finding arc length   Find the arc length of from to .    Video solution     We find ; note that on , is differentiable and is also continuous. Using the formula, we find the arc length as .

The previous examples found the arc length exactly through careful choice of the functions. In general, exact answers are much more difficult to come by and numerical approximations are necessary.   Approximating arc length numerically   Find the length of the sine curve from to .    This is somewhat of a mathematical curiosity; in Example we found the area under one hump of the sine curve is 2 square units; now we are measuring its arc length.  The setup is straightforward: and . Thus .  This integral cannot be evaluated in terms of elementary functions so we will approximate it with Simpson's Method with .

Using a computer with the approximation is ; our approximation with is quite good.      Surface Area of Solids of Revolution  We have already seen how a curve on can be revolved around an axis to form a solid. Instead of computing its volume, we now consider its surface area.   Video introduction to     Establishing the formula for surface area                       We begin as we have in the previous sections: we partition the interval with subintervals, where the th subinterval is . On each subinterval, we can approximate the curve with a straight line that connects and as shown in Figure . Revolving this line segment about the -axis creates part of a cone (called a frustum of a cone) as shown in Figure . The surface area of a frustum of a cone is .  The length is given by ; we use the material just covered by arc length to state that for some in the th subinterval. The radii are just the function evaluated at the endpoints of the interval. That is, .  Thus the surface area of this sample frustum of the cone is approximately .  Since is a continuous function, the Intermediate Value Theorem states there is some in such that ; we can use this to rewrite the above equation as .  Summing over all the subintervals we get the total surface area to be approximately , which is a Riemann Sum. Taking the limit as the subinterval lengths go to zero gives us the exact surface area, given in the following theorem.   Surface Area of a Solid of Revolution   Let be differentiable on , where is also continuous on . integration surface area  surface area solid of revolution      The surface area of the solid formed by revolving the graph of , where , about the -axis is .    The surface area of the solid formed by revolving the graph of about the -axis, where , is .       (When revolving about the -axis, the radii of the resulting frustum are and ; their average value is simply the midpoint of the interval. In the limit, this midpoint is just . This gives the second part of Theorem .)   Finding surface area of a solid of revolution   Find the surface area of the solid formed by revolving on around the -axis, as shown in Figure .   Revolving on about the -axis           Video solution     The setup is relatively straightforward. Using Theorem , we have the surface area is: .  The integration step above is nontrivial, utilizing the integration method of Trigonometric Substitution from Section .  It is interesting to see that the surface area of a solid, whose shape is defined by a trigonometric function, involves both a square root and an inverse hyperbolic trigonometric function.     Finding surface area of a solid of revolution   Find the surface area of the solid formed by revolving the curve on about:     the -axis    the -axis.      The solids used in Example                         Video solution        The integral is straightforward to setup: . The solid formed by revolving around the -axis is graphed in Figure .    Since we are revolving around the -axis, the radius of the solid is not but rather . Thus the integral to compute the surface area is: . The solid formed by revolving about the -axis is graphed in Figure .       Our final example is a famous mathematical paradox.    The surface area and volume of Gabriel's Horn   Consider the solid formed by revolving about the -axis on . Find the volume and surface area of this solid. (This shape, as graphed in Figure , is known as Gabriel's Horn since it looks like a very long horn that only a supernatural person, such as an angel, could play.) Gabriel's Horn    A graph of Gabriel's Horn           Video solution     To compute the volume it is natural to use the Disk Method. We have: .  Gabriel's Horn has a finite volume of cubic units. Since we have already seen that regions with infinite length can have a finite area, this is not too difficult to accept.  We now consider its surface area. The integral is straightforward to setup: .  By Key Idea , the improper integral on the left diverges. Since the integral on the right is larger, we conclude it also diverges, meaning Gabriel's Horn has infinite surface area.  Hence the paradox : we can fill Gabriel's Horn with a finite amount of paint, but since it has infinite surface area, we can never paint it.  Somehow this paradox is striking when we think about it in terms of volume and area. However, we have seen a similar paradox before, as referenced above. We know that the area under the curve on is finite, yet the shape has an infinite perimeter. Strange things can occur when we deal with the infinite.    A standard equation from physics is Work = force distance , when the force applied is constant. In we learn how to compute work when the force applied is variable.     Terms and Concepts    T\/F: The integral formula for computing Arc Length was found by first approximating arc length with straight line segments.   T         T\/F: The integral formula for computing Arc Length includes a square-root, meaning the integration is probably easy.

  "body": " Work    Work is the scientific term used to describe the action of a force which moves an object. When a constant force is applied to move an object a distance , the amount of work performed is .  The SI unit of force is the newton ; one newton is equal to one , and the SI unit of distance is a meter (m). The fundamental unit of work is one newton meter, or a joule (J). That is, applying a force of one newton for one meter performs one joule of work. In Imperial units (as used in the United States), force is measured in pounds (lb) and distance is measured in feet (ft), hence work is measured in ft lb.    Mass and weight are closely related, yet different, concepts. The mass of an object is a quantitative measure of that object's resistance to acceleration. The weight of an object is a measurement of the force applied to the object by the acceleration of gravity .  Since the two measurements are proportional, , they are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation. When computing work, one must be careful to note which is being referred to. When mass is given, it must be multiplied by the acceleration of gravity to reference the related force.   When force is constant, the measurement of work is straightforward. For instance, lifting a 200 object 5 performs ft lb of work.  What if the force applied is variable? For instance, imagine a climber pulling a 200 rope up a vertical face. The rope becomes lighter as more is pulled in, requiring less force and hence the climber performs less work.    Work Done by a Variable Force  In general, let be a force function on an interval . We want to measure the amount of work done applying the force from to . We can approximate the amount of work being done by partitioning into subintervals and assuming that is constant on each subinterval. Let be a value in the th subinterval . Then the work done on this interval is approximately , a constant force the distance over which it is applied. The total work is .  This, of course, is a Riemann sum. Taking a limit as the subinterval lengths go to zero gives an exact value of work which can be evaluated through a definite integral.   Work  Let be a continuous function on describing the amount of force being applied to an object in the direction of travel from distance to distance . The total work done on is integration work  work  .    Computing work performed: applying variable force   A 60 climbing rope is hanging over the side of a tall cliff. How much work is performed in pulling the rope up to the top, where the rope has a linear mass density of 66 ?    We need to create a force function on the interval . To do so, we must first decide what is measuring: is it the length of the rope still hanging or is it the amount of rope pulled in? As long as we are consistent, either approach is fine. We adopt for this example the convention that is the amount of rope pulled in. This seems to match intuition better; pulling up the first meters of rope involves to instead of to .  As is the amount of rope pulled in, the amount of rope still hanging is . This length of rope has a mass of 66 or 0.066 . The mass of the rope still hanging is  ; multiplying this mass by the acceleration of gravity, 9.8 , gives our variable force function .  Thus the total work performed in pulling up the rope is .  By comparison, consider the work done in lifting the entire rope meters. The rope weighs N, so the work applying this force for meters is J. This is exactly twice the work calculated before (and we leave it to the reader to understand why.)     Computing work performed: applying variable force   Consider again pulling a 60 rope up a cliff face, where the rope has a mass of 66 . At what point is exactly half the work performed?    From Example we know the total work performed is J. We want to find a height such that the work in pulling the rope from a height of to a height of is , or half the total work. Thus we want to solve the equation for .   As the rope is only 60 long, the only sensible answer is . Thus about half the work is done pulling up the first 17.57 ; the other half of the work is done pulling up the remaining 42.43 .   In Example , we find that half of the work performed in pulling up a 60 rope is done in the last 42.43 . Why is it not coincidental that ?      Computing work performed: applying variable force   A box of 100 of sand is being pulled up at a uniform rate a distance of 50 over minute. The sand is leaking from the box at a rate of 1 . The box itself weighs 5 and is pulled by a rope weighing 0.2 .     How much work is done lifting just the rope?    How much work is done lifting just the box and sand?    What is the total amount of work performed?          We start by forming the force function for the rope (where the subscript denotes we are considering the rope). As in the previous example, let denote the amount of rope, in feet, pulled in. (This is the same as saying denotes the height of the box.) The weight of the rope with feet pulled in is . (Note that we do not have to include the acceleration of gravity here, for the weight of the rope per foot is given, not its mass per meter as before.) The work performed lifting the rope is .    The sand is leaving the box at a rate of 1 . As the vertical trip is to take one minute, we know that 60 will have left when the box reaches its final height of 50 . Again letting represent the height of the box, we have two points on the line that describes the weight of the sand: when , the sand weight is 100 , producing the point ; when , the sand in the box weighs 40 , producing the point . The slope of this line is , giving the equation of the weight of the sand at height as . The box itself weighs a constant 5 , so the total force function is . Integrating from to gives the work performed in lifting box and sand: .    The total work is the sum of and : ft lb. We can also arrive at this via integration: .         Hooke's Law and Springs  Hooke's Law states that the force required to compress or stretch a spring units from its natural length is proportional to ; that is, this force is for some constant . For example, if a force of 1 stretches a given spring 2 , then a force of 5 will stretch the spring 10 . Converting the distances to meters, we have that stretching this spring 0.02 requires a force of  , hence  . Hooke's Law    Computing work performed: stretching a spring   A force of 20 stretches a spring from a natural length of inches to a length of inches. How much work was performed in stretching the spring to this length?    In many ways, we are not at all concerned with the actual length of the spring, only with the amount of its change. Hence, we do not care that 20 of force stretches the spring to a length of inches, but rather that a force of 20 stretches the spring by inches. This is illustrated in Figure ; we only measure the change in the spring's length, not the overall length of the spring.    Illustrating the important aspects of stretching a spring in computing work in Example        Converting the units of length to feet, we have .  Thus  and .  We compute the total work performed by integrating from to : .      Pumping Fluids  Another useful example of the application of integration to compute work comes in the pumping of fluids, often illustrated in the context of emptying a storage tank by pumping the fluid out the top. This situation is different than our previous examples for the forces involved are constant. After all, the force required to move one cubic foot of water (about 62.4 ) is the same regardless of its location in the tank. What is variable is the distance that cubic foot of water has to travel; water closer to the top travels less distance than water at the bottom, producing less work.   Weight and Mass densities    Fluid  lb\/ft  kg\/m         Concrete      Fuel Oil      Gasoline      Iodine      Methanol      Mercury      Milk      Water       We demonstrate how to compute the total work done in pumping a fluid out of the top of a tank in the next two examples.   Computing work performed: pumping fluids   A cylindrical storage tank with a radius of 10 and a height of 30 is filled with water, which weighs approximately 62.4 . Compute the amount of work performed by pumping the water up to a point feet above the top of the tank.    We will refer often to Figure which illustrates the salient aspects of this problem.   Illustrating a water tank in order to compute the work required to empty it in Example         We start as we often do: we partition an interval into subintervals. We orient our tank vertically since this makes intuitive sense with the base of the tank at . Hence the top of the water is at , meaning we are interested in subdividing the -interval into subintervals as .  Consider the work of pumping only the water residing in the th subinterval, illustrated in Figure . The force required to move this water is equal to its weight which we calculate as volume density. The volume of water in this subinterval is ; its density is 62.4 . Thus the required force is  .  We approximate the distance the force is applied by using any -value contained in the th subinterval; for simplicity, we arbitrarily use for now (it will not matter later on). The water will be pumped to a point feet above the top of the tank, that is, to the height of  . Thus the distance the water at height travels is  .  In all, the approximate work peformed in moving the water in the th subinterval to a point feet above the tank is .  To approximate the total work performed in pumping out all the water from the tank, we sum all the work performed in pumping the water from each of the subintervals of : .  This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as the subinterval length goes to 0 gives .    We can streamline the above process a bit as we may now recognize what the important features of the problem are. Figure shows the tank from Example without the th subinterval identified.   A simplified illustration for computing work         Instead, we just draw one differential element. This helps establish the height a small amount of water must travel along with the force required to move it (where the force is volume density).  We demonstrate the concepts again in the next examples.   Computing work performed: pumping fluids   A conical water tank has its top at ground level and its base 10 feet below ground. The radius of the cone at ground level is 2 . It is filled with water weighing 62.4 and is to be emptied by pumping the water to a spigot 3 feet above ground level. Find the total amount of work performed in emptying the tank.    The conical tank is sketched in Figure . We can orient the tank in a variety of ways; we could let represent the base of the tank and represent the top of the tank, but we choose to keep the convention of the wording given in the problem and let represent ground level and hence represents the bottom of the tank. The actual height of the water does not matter; rather, we are concerned with the distance the water travels.   A graph of the conical water tank in Example         The figure also sketches a differential element, a cross-sectional circle. The radius of this circle is variable, depending on . When , the circle has radius 0; when , the circle has radius 2. These two points, and , allow us to find the equation of the line that gives the radius of the cross-sectional circle, which is . Hence the volume of water at this height is , where represents a very small height of the differential element. The force required to move the water at height is .  The distance the water at height travels is given by . Thus the total work done in pumping the water from the tank is .     Computing work performed: pumping fluids   A rectangular swimming pool is 20 wide and has a 3  shallow end and a 6  deep end. It is to have its water pumped out to a point 2 above the current top of the water. The cross-sectional dimensions of the water in the pool are given in Figure ; note that the dimensions are for the water, not the pool itself. Compute the amount of work performed in draining the pool.   The cross-section of a swimming pool filled with water in Example           For the purposes of this problem we choose to set to represent the bottom of the pool, meaning the top of the water is at .   Orienting the pool and showing differential elements for Example          Figure shows the pool oriented with this -axis, along with 2 differential elements as the pool must be split into two different regions.  The top region lies in the -interval of , where the length of the differential element is 25 as shown. As the pool is 20 wide, this differential element represents a thin slice of water with volume . The water is to be pumped to a height of , so the height function is . The work done in pumping this top region of water is .  The bottom region lies in the -interval of ; we need to compute the length of the differential element in this interval.  One end of the differential element is at and the other is along the line segment joining the points and . The equation of this line is ; as we will be integrating with respect to , we rewrite this equation as . So the length of the differential element is a difference of -values: and , giving a length of .  Again, as the pool is 20 wide, this differential element represents a thin slice of water with volume ; the height function is the same as before at . The work performed in emptying this part of the pool is .  The total work in empyting the pool is .  Notice how the emptying of the bottom of the pool performs almost as much work as emptying the top. The top portion travels a shorter distance but has more water. In the end, this extra water produces more work.    The next section introduces one final application of the definite integral, the calculation of fluid force on a plate.     Terms and Concepts   What are the typical units of work?   In SI units, it is one joule, , one newton meter, or   In Imperial Units, it is ft lb.

Could one conclude that the work done lifting the cable is negligible compared to the work done lifting the load?         756 ft lb    60,000 ft lb    Yes, for the cable accounts for about 1% of the total work.

Note that the tank is oriented horizontally. Let the origin be the center of one of the circular ends of the tank. Since the radius is 3.75 , the fluid is being pumped to ; thus the distance the gas travels is . A differential element of water is a rectangle, with length 20 and width . Thus the force required to move that slab of gas is . Total work is . This can be evaluated without actual integration; split the integral into . The first integral can be evaluated as measuring half the area of a circle; the latter integral can be shown to be 0 without much difficulty. (Use substitution and realize the bounds are both 0.)

  "body": " Fluid Forces  In the unfortunate situation of a car driving into a body of water, the conventional wisdom is that the water pressure on the doors will quickly be so great that they will be effectively unopenable. (Survival techniques suggest immediately opening the door, rolling down or breaking the window, or waiting until the water fills up the interior at which point the pressure is equalized and the door will open. See Mythbusters episode #72 to watch Adam Savage test these options.)  How can this be true? How much force does it take to open the door of a submerged car? In this section we will find the answer to this question by examining the forces exerted by fluids.  We start with pressure , which is related to force by the following equations: .  In the context of fluids, we have the following definition.   Fluid Pressure   Let be the weight-density of a fluid. The pressure  exerted on an object at depth in the fluid is . fluid pressure\/force  integration fluid force     We use this definition to find the force exerted on a horizontal sheet by considering the sheet's area.   Computing fluid force      A cylindrical storage tank has a radius of 2 and holds 10 of a fluid with a weight-density of 50 . (See Figure .) What is the force exerted on the base of the cylinder by the fluid?   A cylindrical tank in Example           A rectangular tank whose base is a 5 square has a circular hatch at the bottom with a radius of 2 . The tank holds 10 of a fluid with a weight-density of 50 . (See Figure .) What is the force exerted on the hatch by the fluid?   A rectangular tank in Example                 Using Definition , we calculate that the pressure exerted on the cylinder's base is 50  10 500 . The area of the base is  . So the force exerted by the fluid is . Note that we effectively just computed the weight of the fluid in the tank.    The dimensions of the tank in this problem are irrelevant. All we are concerned with are the dimensions of the hatch and the depth of the fluid. Since the dimensions of the hatch are the same as the base of the tank in the previous part of this example, as is the depth, we see that the fluid force is the same. That is,  . A key concept to understand here is that we are effectively measuring the weight of a 10 column of water above the hatch. The size of the tank holding the fluid does not matter.       The previous example demonstrates that computing the force exerted on a horizontally oriented plate is relatively easy to compute. What about a vertically oriented plate? For instance, suppose we have a circular porthole located on the side of a submarine. How do we compute the fluid force exerted on it?  Pascal's Principle states that the pressure exerted by a fluid at a depth is equal in all directions. Thus the pressure on any portion of a plate that is 1 below the surface of water is the same no matter how the plate is oriented. (Thus a hollow cube submerged at a great depth will not simply be crushed from above, but the sides will also crumple in. The fluid will exert force on all sides of the cube.)  So consider a vertically oriented plate as shown in Figure submerged in a fluid with weight-density . What is the total fluid force exerted on this plate? We find this force by first approximating the force on small horizontal strips.   A thin, vertically oriented plate submerged in a fluid with weight-density         Let the top of the plate be at depth and let the bottom be at depth . (For now we assume that surface of the fluid is at depth 0, so if the bottom of the plate is 3 under the surface, we have . We will come back to this later.) We partition the interval into subintervals , with the th subinterval having length . The force exerted on the plate in the th subinterval is .  The pressure is depth times the weight density . We approximate the depth of this thin strip by choosing any value in ; the depth is approximately . (Our convention has being a negative number, so is positive.) For convenience, we let be an endpoint of the subinterval; we let .  The area of the thin strip is approximately length width. The width is . The length is a function of some -value in the th subinterval. We state the length is . Thus .  To approximate the total force, we add up the approximate forces on each of the thin strips: .  This is, of course, another Riemann Sum. We can find the exact force by taking a limit as the subinterval lengths go to ; we evaluate this limit with a definite integral.   Fluid Force on a Vertically Oriented Plate  Let a vertically oriented plate be submerged in a fluid with weight-density , where the top of the plate is at and the bottom is at . Let be the length of the plate at . fluid pressure\/force  integration fluid force    If corresponds to the surface of the fluid, then the force exerted on the plate by the fluid is .    In general, let represent the distance between the surface of the fluid and the plate at . Then the force exerted on the plate by the fluid is .       Finding fluid force   Consider a thin plate in the shape of an isosceles triangle as shown in Figure , submerged in water with a weight-density of 62.4 . If the bottom of the plate is 10 below the surface of the water, what is the total fluid force exerted on this plate?   A thin plate in the shape of an isosceles triangle in Example           We approach this problem in two different ways to illustrate the different ways Key Idea can be implemented. First we will let represent the surface of the water, then we will consider an alternate convention.     We let represent the surface of the water; therefore the bottom of the plate is at . We center the triangle on the -axis as shown in Figure . The depth of the plate at is as indicated by the Key Idea. We now consider the length of the plate at . We need to find equations of the left and right edges of the plate. The right hand side is a line that connects the points and : that line has equation . (Find the equation in the familiar format and solve for .) Likewise, the left hand side is described by the line . The total length is the distance between these two lines: .   Sketching the triangular plate in Example with the convention that the water level is at         The total fluid force is then: .    Sometimes it seems easier to orient the thin plate nearer the origin. For instance, consider the convention that the bottom of the triangular plate is at , as shown in Figure . The equations of the left and right hand sides are easy to find. They are and , respectively, which we rewrite as and . Thus the length function is .   Sketching the triangular plate in Example with the convention that the base of the triangle is at         As the surface of the water is 10 above the base of the plate, we have that the surface of the water is at . Thus the depth function is the distance between and ; . We compute the total fluid force as: .     The correct answer is, of course, independent of the placement of the plate in the coordinate plane as long as we are consistent.     Finding fluid force   Find the total fluid force on a car door submerged up to the bottom of its window in water, where the car door is a rectangle 40 long and 27 high (based on the dimensions of a 2005 Fiat Grande Punto.)    The car door, as a rectangle, is drawn in Figure . Its length is ft and its height is 2.25 . We adopt the convention that the top of the door is at the surface of the water, both of which are at . Using the weight-density of water of 62.4 , we have the total force as .  Most adults would find it very difficult to apply over 500 of force to a car door while seated inside, making the door effectively impossible to open. This is counter-intuitive as most assume that the door would be relatively easy to open. The truth is that it is not, hence the survival tips mentioned at the beginning of this section.   Sketching a submerged car door in Example            Finding fluid force   An underwater observation tower is being built with circular viewing portholes enabling visitors to see underwater life. Each vertically oriented porthole is to have a 3 diameter whose center is to be located 50 underwater. Find the total fluid force exerted on each porthole. Also, compute the fluid force on a horizontally oriented porthole that is under 50 of water.   Measuring the fluid force on an underwater porthole in Example           We place the center of the porthole at the origin, meaning the surface of the water is at and the depth function will be ; see Figure   The equation of a circle with a radius of 1.5 is ; solving for we have , where the positive square root corresponds to the right side of the circle and the negative square root corresponds to the left side of the circle. Thus the length function at depth is . Integrating on we have: .  The second integral above can be evaluated using substitution. Let with . The new bounds are: and ; the new integral will integrate from to , hence the integral is 0.  The first integral above finds the area of half a circle of radius 1.5, thus the first integral evaluates to . Thus the total fluid force on a vertically oriented porthole is 22,054 .  Finding the force on a horizontally oriented porthole is more straightforward: .  That these two forces are equal is not coincidental; it turns out that the fluid force applied to a vertically oriented circle whose center is at depth is the same as force applied to a horizontally oriented circle at depth .    We end this chapter with a reminder of the true skills meant to be developed here. We are not truly concerned with an ability to find fluid forces or the volumes of solids of revolution. Work done by a variable force is important, though measuring the work done in pulling a rope up a cliff is probably not.  What we are actually concerned with is the ability to solve certain problems by first approximating the solution, then refining the approximation, then recognizing if\/when this refining process results in a definite integral through a limit. Knowing the formulas found inside the special boxes within this chapter is beneficial as it helps solve problems found in the exercises, and other mathematical skills are strengthened by properly applying these formulas. However, more importantly, understand how each of these formulas was constructed.

We explored the simple differential equation , and saw that a solution to a differential equation is simply a function that satisfies the differential equation.   Video introduction to Section      Introduction and Terminology   Differential Equation   Given a function , a differential equation is an equation relating , and derivatives of .   The variable is called the independent variable .    The variable is called the dependent variable .    The order of the differential equation is the order of the highest derivative of that appears in the equation.    differential equation definition  order of a differential equation  differential equation order of     Let us return to the simple differential equation .

So do the functions and .  We call the function , with an arbitrary constant of integration, the general solution to the differential equation. general solution of a differential equation  differential equation general solution   In order to specify the value of the integration constant , we require additional information. For example, if we know that , it follows that . This additional information is called an initial condition.    Initial Value Problem   A differential equation paired with an initial condition (or initial conditions) is called an initial value problem.  initial value problem for differential equations  initial condition   The solution to an initial value problem is called a particular solution . differential equation particular solution A particular solution does not include arbitrary constants.  The family of solutions to a differential equation that encompasses all possible solutions is called the general solution to the differential equation. differential equation general solution       Note: A general solution typically includes one or more arbitrary constants. Different values of the constant(s) specify different members in the family of solutions. The particular solution to an initial value problem is the specific member in the family of solutions that corresponds to the given initial condition(s).    A simple first-order differential equation   Solve the differential equation .    Video solution     The solution is a function such that differentiation yields twice the original function. Unlike our starting example, finding the solution here does not involve computing an antiderivative. Notice that integrating both sides would yield the result , which is not useful. Without knowledge of the function , we can't compute the indefinite integral. Later sections will explore systematic ways to find analytic solutions to simple differential equations. For now, a bit of thought might let us guess the solution .  Notice that application of the chain rule yields . Another solution is given by .  In fact, , where is any constant, is the general solution to the differential equation because .  If we are provided with a single initial condition, say , we can identify so that is the particular solution to the initial value problem .   Figure shows various members of the general solution to the differential equation . Each value yields a different member of the family, and a different function. We emphasize the particular solution corresponding to the initial condition .   A representation of some of the members of general solution to the differential equation , including the particular solution to the initial value problem with , from Example          A second-order differential equation   Solve the differential equation .    Video solution     We seek a function whose second derivative is negative 9 multiplied by the original function. Both and have this feature. The general solution to the differential equation is given by , where and are arbitrary constants. To fully specify a particular solution, we require two additional conditions. For example, the initial conditions and yield .    The differential equation in Example is second order , because the equation involves a second derivative. In general, the number of initial conditions required to specify a particular solution depends on the order of the differential equation. For the remainder of the chapter, we restrict our attention to first order differential equations and first order initial value problems.   Verifying a solution to the differential equation   Which of the following is a solution to the differential equation ?           Video solution     Verifying a solution to a differential equation is simply an exercise in differentiation and simplification. We substitute each potential solution into the differential equation to see if it satisfies the equation.     Testing the potential solution :  Differentiating, we have . Substituting into the differential equation, .  Since it doesn't satisfy the differential equation, is not a solution.    Testing the potential solution :  Differentiating, we have . Substituting into the differential equation,   Thus  is a solution to the differential equation.    Testing the potential solution :  Differentiating, . Substituting into the differential equation, .  The function is not a solution to the differential equation.        Verifying a solution to a differential equation   Verify that is a solution to .    Video solution     The solution in this example is called an implicit solution. That means the dependent variable is a function of , but has not been explicitly solved for. Verifying the solution still involves differentiation, but we must take the derivatives implicitly. Differentiating, we have . differential equation implicit soution   Solving for , we have .  From the solution, we know that . Then .  We have verified that is a solution to .      Graphical Solutions to Differential Equations  In the examples we have explored so far, we have found exact forms for the functions that solve the differential equations. Solutions of this type are called analytic solutions. Many times a differential equation has a solution, but it is difficult or impossible to find the solution analytically. This is analogous to algebraic equations. The algebraic equation has two real solutions that can be found analytically by using the quadratic formula. The equation has one real solution, but we can't find it analytically. As shown in Figure , we can find an approximate solution graphically by plotting and and observing the -value of the intersection. We can similarly use graphical tools to understand the qualitative behavior of solutions to a first order-differential equation.   Graphically finding an approximate solution to       Consider the first-order differential equation .  The function could be any function of the two variables and . Written in this way, we can think of the function as providing a formula to find the slope of a solution at a given point in the -plane. In other words, suppose a solution to the differential equation passes through the point . At the point , the slope of the solution curve will be . Since this calculation of the slope is possible at any point where the function is defined, we can produce a plot called a slope field (or direction field) that shows the slope of a solution at any point in the -plane where the solution is defined. Further, this process can be done purely by working with the differential equation itself. In other words, we can draw a slope field and use it to determine the qualitative behavior of solutions to a differential equation without having to solve the differential equation. differential equation graphical solution  direction field slope field    Slope Field   A slope field for a first-order differential equation is a plot in the -plane made up of short line segments or arrows. At each point where is defined, the slope of the line segment is given by . Plots of solutions to a differential equation are tangent to the line segments in the slope field. slope field      Sketching a slope field   Find a slope field for the differential equation .    Because the function is defined for all points , every point in the -plane has an associated line segment. It is not practical to draw an entire slope field by hand, but many tools exist for drawing slope fields on a computer. Here, we explicitly calculate a few of the line segments in the slope field.     The slope of the line segment at is .    The slope of the line segment at is .    The slope of the line segment at is .    The slope of the line segment at is .     Though it is possible to continue this process to sketch a slope field, we usually use a computer to make the drawing. Most popular computer algebra systems can draw slope fields. There are also various online tools that can make the drawings. The slope field for is shown in Figure .   Slope field for from Example          A graphical solution to an initial value problem   Approximate, with a sketch, the solution to the initial value problem , with .    The solution to the initial value problem should be a continuous smooth curve. Using the slope field, we can draw of a sketch of the solution using the following two criteria:   The solution must pass through the point .    When the solution passes through a point it must be tangent to the line segment at .     Essentially, we sketch a solution to the initial value problem by starting at the point and following the lines in either direction. A sketch of the solution is shown in Figure .   Solution to the initial value problem , with from Example          Using a slope field to predict long term behavior   Use the slope field for the differential equation , shown in Figure , to predict long term behavior of solutions to the equation.   Slope field for the logistic differential equation from Example         This differential equation, called the logistic differential equation , often appears in population biology to describe the size of a population. For that reason, we use (time) as the independent variable instead of . We also often restrict attention to non-negative -values because negative values correspond to a negative population. differential equation logistic   Looking at the slope field in Figure , we can predict long term behavior for a given initial condition.   If the initial -value is negative ( ), the solution curve must pass though the point and follow the slope field. We expect the solution to become more and more negative as time increases. Note that this result is not physically relevant when considering a population.    If the initial -value is greater than 0 but less than 1, we expect the solution to increase and level off at .    If the initial -value is greater than 1, we expect the solution to decrease and level off at .     The slope field for the logistic differential equation, along with representative solution curves, is shown in Figure . Notice that any solution curve with positive initial value will tend towards the value . We call this the carrying capacity.  carrying capacity    Slope field for the logistic differential equation from Example with a few representative solution curves           Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations: Euler's Method  While the slope field is an effective way to understand the qualitative behavior of solutions to a differential equation, it is difficult to use a slope field to make quantitative predictions. For example, if we have the slope field for the differential equation from Example along with the initial condition , we can understand the qualitative behavior of the solution to the initial value problem, but will struggle to predict a specific value, for example, with any degree of confidence. The most straightforward way to predict is to find the analytic solution to the the initial value problem and evaluate it at . Unfortunately, we have already mentioned that it is impossible to find analytic solutions to many differential equations. In the absence of an analytic solution, a numerical solution can serve as an effective tool to make quantitative predictions about the solution to an initial value problem.  There are many techniques for computing numerical solutions to initial value problems. A course in numerical analysis will discuss various techniques along with their strengths and weaknesses. The simplest technique is called Euler's Method . differential equation numerical solution    Euler's Method is named for Leonhard Euler, a prolific Swiss mathematician during the 1700's. His last name is properly pronounced oil-er , not you-ler.    Consider the first-order initial value problem .  Using the definition of the derivative, .  This notation can be confusing at first, but simply means the -value of the solution when the -value is , and means the -value of the solution when the -value is .  If we remove the limit but restrict to be small, we have , so that , because according to the differential equation. Rearranging terms, .  This statement says that if we know the solution ( -value) to the initial value problem for some given -value, we can find an approximation for the solution at the value by taking our -value and adding times the function evaluated at the and values. Euler's method uses the initial condition of an initial value problem as the starting point, and then uses the above idea to find approximate values for the solution at later -values. The algorithm is summarized in Key Idea .   Euler's Method  Consider the initial value problem .  Let be a small positive number and be an integer.   For , define .    The value is given by the initial condition. For , define .     This process yields a sequence of points for , where is an approximation for . Euler's Method    Let's practice Euler's Method using a few concrete examples.   Using Euler's Method 1   Find an approximation at for the solution to with using Euler's Method with .    Our initial condition yields the starting values and . With , it takes steps to get to . Using steps 1 and 2 from the Euler's Method algorithm, .  Using Euler's method, we find the approximate .  To help visualize the Euler's method approximation, these three points (connected by line segments) are plotted along with the analytical solution to the initial value problem in Figure .   Euler's Method approximation to with from Example , along with the analytical solution to the initial value problem         This approximation doesn't appear terrific, though it is better than merely guessing. Let's repeat the previous example using a smaller -value.   Using Euler's Method 2   Find an approximation on the interval for the solution to with using Euler's Method with .    Our initial condition yields the starting values and . With , we need steps on the interval Using steps 1 and 2 from the Euler's Method algorithm (and rounding to 4 decimal points), we have .  Using Euler's method, we find .  These five points, along with the points from Example and the analytic solution, are plotted in Figure .   Euler's Method approximations to with from Examples and , along with the analytical solution         Using the results from Examples and , we can make a few observations about Euler's method. First, the Euler approximation generally gets worse as we get farther from the initial condition. This is because Euler's method involves two sources of error. The first comes from the fact that we're using a positive -value in the derivative approximation instead of using a limit as approaches zero. Essentially, we're using a linear approximation to the solution (similar to the process described in Section on Differentials.) This error is often called the local truncation error. The second source of error comes from the fact that every step in Euler's method uses the result of the previous step. That means we're using an approximate -value to approximate the next -value. Doing this repeatedly causes the errors to build on each other. This second type of error is often called the propagated or accumulated error.  accumulated error using Euler's method  Euler's method accumulated error   A second observation is that the Euler approximation is more accurate for smaller -values. This accuracy comes at a cost, though. Example is more accurate than Example , but takes twice as many computations. In general, numerical algorithms (even when performed by a computer program) require striking a balance between a desired level of accuracy and the amount of computational effort we are willing to undertake.  Let's do one final example of Euler's Method.   Using Euler's Method 3   Find an approximation for the solution to the logistic differential equation   with , for . Use steps.    The logistic differential equation is what is called an autonomous equation . An autonomous differential equation has no explicit dependence on the independent variable ( in this case). This has no real effect on the application of Euler's method other than the fact that the function is really just a function of . To take steps in the variable, we use .  Using steps requires . Implementing Euler's Method, we have .  These 11 points, along with the the analytic solution, are plotted in Figure . Notice how well they seem to match the true solution.   Euler's Method approximation to with from Example , along with the analytical solution         The study of differential equations is a natural extension of the study of derivatives and integrals. The equations themselves involve derivatives, and methods to find analytic solutions often involve finding antiderivatives. In this section, we focus on graphical and numerical techniques to understand solutions to differential equations. We restrict our examples to relatively simple initial value problems that permit analytic solutions to the equations, but we should remember that this is only for comparison purposes. In reality, many differential equations, even some that appear straightforward, do not have solutions we can find analytically. Even so, we can use the techniques presented in this section to understand the behavior of solutions. In the next two sections, we explore two techniques to find analytic solutions to two different classes of differential equations.     Terms and Concepts   In your own words, what is an initial value problem, and how is it different than a differential equation?   An initial value problems is a differential equation that is paired with one or more initial conditions. A differential equation is simply the equation without the initial conditions.    In your own words, describe what it means for a function to be a solution to a differential equation.   Answers will vary.    How can we verify that a function is a solution to a differential equation?   Substitute the proposed function into the differential equation, and show the the statement is satisfied.    Describe the difference between a particular solution and a general solution.   A particular solution is one specifica member of a family of solutions, and has no arbitrary constants. A general solution is a family of solutions, includes all possible solutions to the differential equation, and typically includes one or more arbitrary constants.    Why might we use a graphical or numerical technique to study solutions to a differential equation instead of simply solving the differential equation to find an analytic solution?   Many differential equations are impossible to solve analytically.    Describe the considerations that should be made when choosing an value to use in a numerical method like Euler's Method.   A smaller value leads to a numerical solution that is closer to the true solution, but decreasing the value leads to more computational effort.

  "title": "Separable Differential Equations",
  "body": " Separable Differential Equations   There are specific techniques that can be used to solve specific types of differential equations. This is similar to solving algebraic equations. In algebra, we can use the quadratic formula to solve a quadratic equation, but not a linear or cubic equation. In the same way, techniques that can be used for a specific type of differential equation are often ineffective for a differential equation of a different type. In this section, we describe and practice a technique to solve a class of differential equations called separable equations.    Video introduction to Section     Separable Differential Equation   A separable differential equation is one that can be written in the form , where is a function that depends only on the dependent variable , and is a function that depends only on the independent variable . differential equation separable     Below, we show a few examples of separable differential equations, along with similar looking equations that are not separable.    Separable         Not Separable         Notice that a separable equation requires that the functions of the dependent and independent variables be multiplied, not added (like item in List ). An alternate definition of a separable differential equation states that an equation is separable if it can be written in the form , for some functions and .    Separation of Variables   separation of variables Let's find a formal solution to the separable equation .  Since the functions on the left and right hand sides of the equation are equal, their antiderivatives should be equal up to an arbitrary constant of integration. That is .  Though the integral on the left may look a bit strange, recall that itself is a function of . Consider the substitution . The differential is . Using this substitution, the above equation becomes .  Let and be antiderivatives of and , respectively. Then .  Since , this is .  This relationship between and is an implicit form of the solution to the differential equation. Sometimes (but not always) it is possible to solve for to find an explicit version of the solution.  Though the technique outlined above is formally correct, what we did essentially amounts to integrating the function with respect to its variable and integrating the function with respect to its variable. The informal way to solve a separable equation is to treat the derivative as if it were a fraction. The separated form of the equation is .  To solve, we integrate the left hand side with respect to and the right hand side with respect to and add a constant of integration. As long as we are able to find the antiderivatives, we can find an implicit form for the solution. Sometimes we are able to solve for in the implicit solution to find an explicit form of the solution to the differential equation. We practice the technique by solving the three differential equations listed in the separable column above, and conclude by revisiting and finding the general solution to the logistic differential equation from Section .   Solving a Separable Differential Equation   Find the general solution to the differential equation .    Video solution     Using the informal solution method outlined above, we treat as a fraction, and write the separated form of the differential equation as .   The indefinite integrals and both produce arbitrary constants. Since both constants are arbitrary, we combine them into a single constant of integration.   Integrating the left hand side of the equation with respect to and the right hand side of the equation with respect to yields .  This is an implicit form of the solution to the differential equation. Solving for yields an explicit form for the solution. Exponentiating both sides, we have .  This solution is a bit problematic. First, the absolute value makes the solution difficult to understand. The second issue comes from our desire to find the general solution. Recall that a general solution includes all possible solutions to the differential equation. In other words, for any given initial condition, the general solution must include the solution to that specific initial value problem. We can often satisfy any given initial condition by choosing an appropriate value. When solving separable equations, though, it is possible to lose solutions that have the form . Notice that solves the differential equation, but it is not possible to choose a finite to make our solution look like . Our solution cannot solve the initial value problem , with (where is any value). Thus, we haven't actually found a general solution to the problem. We can clean up the solution and recover the missing solution with a bit of clever thought.   Missing constant solutions can't always be recovered by cleverly redefining the arbitrary constant. The differential equation is an example of this fact. Both and are constant solutions to this differential equation. Separation of variables yields a solution where can be attained by choosing an appropriate value, but can't. The general solution is the set containing the solution produced by separation of variables and the missing solution . We should always be careful to look for missing constant solutions when seeking the general solution to a separable differential equation.   Recall the formal definition of the absolute value: if and if . Our solution is either or . Further, note that is constant, so is also constant. If we write our solution as , and allow the constant to take on either positive or negative values, we incorporate both cases of the absolute value. Finally, if we allow to be zero, we recover the missing solution discussed above. The best way to express the general solution to our differential equation is .     Solving a Separable Initial Value Problem   Solve the initial value problem , with .    Video solution     We first put the differential equation in separated form .  The indefinite integral requires the substitution . Using this substitute yields the antiderivative . The indefinite integral requires the substitution . Using this substitution yields the antiderivative . Thus, we have an implicit form of the solution to the differential equation given by .  The initial condition says that should be when is , or .  Evaluating the line above, we find , yielding the particular solution to the initial value problem .     Solving a Separable Differential Equation   Find the general solution to the differential equation .    Video solution     We start by observing that there are no constant solutions to this differential equation because there are no constant values that make the right hand side of the equation identically zero. Thus, we need not worry about losing solutions during the separation of variables process. The separated form of the equation is given by .  The antiderivative of the left hand side requires Integration by Parts. Evaluating both indefinite integrals yields the implicit solution .  Since we cannot solve for , we cannot find an explicit form of the solution.     Solving the Logistic Differential Equation   Solve the logistic differential equation     Video solution     We looked at a slope field for this equation in Section in the specific case of . Here, we use separation of variables to find an analytic solution to the more general equation. Notice that the independent variable does not explicitly appear in the differential equation. We mentioned that an equation of this type is called autonomous . All autonomous first order differential equations are separable.  We start by making the observation that both and are constant solutions to the differential equation. We must check that these solutions are not lost during the separation of variables process. The separated form of the equation is .  The antiderivative of the left hand side of the equation can be found by making use of partial fractions. Using the techniques discussed in Section , we write .  Then an implicit form of the solution is given by .  Combining the logarithms, .  Similarly to Example , we can write .  Letting take on positive values or negative values incorporates both cases of the absolute value. This is another implicit form of the solution. Solving for gives the explicit form , where is an arbitrary constant. Notice that recovers the constant solution . The constant solution cannot be produced with a finite value, and has been lost. The general solution the logistic differential equation is the set containing and .     Solving for initially yields the explicit solution . Dividing numerator and denominator by and defining yields the commonly presented form of the solution given in Example .      Problems    In the following exercises, decide whether the differential equation is separable or not separable. If the equation is separable. write it in separated form.        Separable.         Not separable.        Not separable.        Separable.       In the following exercises, find the general solution to the separable differential equation.

  "body": " First Order Linear Differential Equations   In the previous section, we explored a specific techique to solve a specific type of differential equation called a separable differential equation. In this section, we develop and practice a technique to solve a type of differential equation called a first order linear differential equation.  Recall than a linear algebraic equation in one variable is one that can be written , where and are real numbers. Notice that the variable appears to the first power. The equations and are both nonlinear. A linear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable and its derivatives appear only to the first power. We focus on first order equations, which involve first (but not higher order) derivatives of the dependent variable.   Introduction to , and presentation of      Solving First Order Linear Equations   First Order Linear Differential Equation   A first order linear differential equation is a differential equation that can be written in the form , where and are arbitrary functions of the independent variable . differential equation first order linear      Classifying Differential Equations   Classify each differential equation as first order linear, separable, both, or neither.               Both. We identify and . The separated form of the equation is .    Neither. The term makes the equation nonlinear. Because of the addition, it is not possible to write the equation in separated form.    First order linear. We identify and . The equation cannot be written in separated form.    Neither. Notice that dividing by results in the nonlinear term . It is not possible to write the equation in separated form.       Notice that linearity depends on the dependent variable , not the independent variable . The functions and need not be linear, as demonstrated in part (c) of Example . Neither nor are linear functions of , but the differential equation is still linear.  Before working out a general technique for solving first order linear differential equations, we look at a specific example. Consider the differential equation .  This is an easy differential equation to solve. On the left, the antiderivative of the derivative is simply the function . Using the substitution on the right and integrating results in the implicit solution .  Solving for yields the explicit solution .  Though not obvious, the differential equation above is actually a linear differential equation. Using the product rule and implicit differentiation, we can write . Our original differential equation can be written .  If we divide by , we have , which matches the form in Definition . Reversing our steps would lead us back to the original form our our differential equation.   In the examples in the previous section, we performed operations on the arbitrary constant , but still called the result . The justification is that the result after the operation is still an arbitrary contant. Here, we divide by , so the result depends explicitly on the independent variable . Since is not contant, we can't just call it .   As motivated by the problem we just explored, the basic idea behind solving first order linear differential equations is to multiply both sides of the differential equation by a function, called an integrating factor , that makes the left hand side of the equation look like an expanded Product Rule. We then condense the left hand side into the derivative of a product and integrate both sides. An obvious question is, How do you find this integrating factor?  differential equation integrating factor    Using an integrating factor to solve a linear differential equation    Consider the first order linear equation .  Let's call the integrating factor . We multiply both sides of the differential equation by to get .   Though we use for our integrating factor, the symbol is unimportant. The notation is a common choice, but other texts my use , or some other symbol to designate the integrating factor.   Our goal is to choose so that the left hand side of the differential equation looks like the result of a Product Rule. The left hand side of the equation is .  Using the Product Rule and Implicit Differentiation, .  Equating and gives , which is equivalent to .  In order for the integrating factor to perform its job, it must solve the differential equation above. But that differential equation is separable, so we can solve it. The separated form is .  Integrating, , or .   Following the steps outlined in the previous section, we should technically end up with , where is an arbitrary constant. Because we multiply both sides of the differential equation by , the arbitrary constant cancels, and we omit it when finding the integrating factor.   If is chosen this way, after multiplying by , we can always write the differential equation in the form .  Integrating and solving for , the explicit solution is .  Though this formula can be used to write down the solution to a first order linear equation, we shy away from simply memorizing a formula. The process is lost, and it's easy to forget the formula. Rather, we always always follow the steps outlined in Key Idea when solving equations of this type.   Solving First Order Linear Equations     Write the differential equation in the form .    Compute the integrating factor .    Multiply both sides of the differential equation by , and condense the left hand side to get .    Integrate both sides of the differential equation with respect to , taking care to remember the arbitrary constant.    Solve for to find the explicit solution to the differential equation.      Let's practice the process by solving the two first order linear differential equations from Example .   Solving a First Order Linear Equation   Find the general solution to .    Video solution     We solve by following the steps in Key Idea . Unlike the process for solving separable equations, we need not worry about losing constant solutions. The answer we find will be the general solution to the differential equation. We first write the equation in the form .  By identifying , we can compute the integrating factor .  Multiplying both side of the differential equation by , we have .  The left hand side of the differential equation condenses to yield .   The step where the left hand side of the differential equation condenses to the derivative of a product can feel a bit magical. The reality is that we choose so that we can get exactly this condensing behavior. It's not magic, it's math! If you're still skeptical, try using the Product Rule and Implicit Differentiation to evaluate , and verify that it becomes .   We integrate both sides with respect to to find the implicit solution , or the explicit solution .     Solving a First Order Linear Equation   Find the general solution to .    Video solution     The differential equation is already in the correct form. The integrating factor is given by .  Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor and condensing,   Using the substitution , we can integrate to find the implicit solution .  The explicit form of the general solution is .    We continue our practice by finding the particular solution to an initial value problem.   Solving a First Order Linear Initial Value Problem   Solve the initial value problem , with .    Video solution     We first divide by to get .  The integrating factor is given by .  Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor and condensing the left hand side, we have .  Using Integrating by Parts to find the antiderivative of , we find the implicit solution .  Solving for , the explicit solution is .  The initial condition yields . The solution to the initial value problem is .    Differential equations are a valuable tool for exploring various physical problems. This process of using equations to describe real world situations is called mathematical modeling, and is the topic of the next section. The last two examples in this section begin our discussion of mathematical modeling.   A Falling Object Without Air Resistance   Suppose an object with mass is dropped from an airplane. Find and solve a differential equation describing the vertical velocity of the object assuming no air resistance.    The basic physical law at play is Newton's second law, .  Using the fact that acceleration is the derivative of velocity, mass acceleration can be writting . In the absence of air resistance, the only force of interest is the force due to gravity. This force is approximately constant, and is given by , where is the gravitational constant. The word equation above can be written as the differential equation .  Because is constant, this differential equation is simply an integration problem, and we find .  Since with , we see that the arbitrary constant here corresponds to the initial vertical velocity of the object.    The process of mathematical modeling does not stop simply because we have found an answer. We must examine the answer to see how well it can describe real world observations. In the previous example, the answer may be somewhat useful for short times, but intuition tells us that something is missing. Our answer says that a falling object's velocity will increase linearly as a function of time, but we know that a falling object does not speed up indefinitely. In order to more fully describe real world behavior, our mathematical model must be revised.   Video presentation of Examples     A Falling Object with Air Resistance   Suppose an object with mass is dropped from an airplane. Find and solve a differential equation describing the vertical velocity of the object, taking air resistance into account.    We still begin with Newon's second law, but now we assume that the forces in the object come both from gravity and from air resistance. The gravitational force is still given by . For air resistance, we assume the force is related to the velocity of the object. A simple way to describe this assumption might be , where is a proportionality constant and is a positive real number. The value depends on various factors such as the density of the object, surface area of the object, and density of the air. The value affects how changes in the velocity affect the force. Taken together, a function of the form is often called a power law . The differential equation for the velocity is given by .  (Notice that the force from air resistance opposes motion, and points in the opposite direction as the force from gravity.) This differential equation is separable, and can be written in the separated form .  For arbitrary positive , the integration is difficult, making this problem hard to solve analytically. In the case that , the differential equation becomes linear, and is easy to solve either using either separation of variables or integrating factor techniques. We assume , and proceed with an integrating factor so we can continue practicing the process. Writing , we identify the integrating factor .  Then , so , or .     The velocity functions from Examples (dashed) and (solid) under the assumption that , with , and       In the solution above, the exponential term decays as time increases, causing the velocity to approach the constant value in the limit as approaches infinity. This value is called the terminal velocity . If we assume a zero initial velocity (the object is dropped, not thrown from the plane), the velocities from Examples and are given by and , respectively. These two functions are shown in Figure , with , and . Notice that the two curves agree well for short times, but have dramatically different behaviors as increases. Part of the art in mathematical modeling is deciding on the level of detail required to answer the question of interest. If we are only interested in the initial behavior of the falling object, the simple model in Example may be sufficient. If we are interested in the longer term behavior of the object, the simple model is not sufficient, and we should consider a more complicated model.     Problems    In the following exercises, Find the general solution to the first order linear differential equation.

  "title": "Modeling with Differential Equations",
  "body": " Modeling with Differential Equations   In the first three sections of this chapter, we focused on the basic ideas behind differential equations and the mechanics of solving certain types of differential equations. We have only hinted at their practical use. In this section, we use differential equations for mathematical modeling, the process of using equations to describe real world processes. We explore a few different mathematical models with the goal of gaining an introduction to this large field of applied mathematics. differential equation modeling     Models Involving Proportional Change  Some of the simplest differential equation models involve one quantity that changes at a rate proportional to another quantity. In the introduction to this chapter, we considered a population that grows at a rate proportional to the current population. The words in this assumption can be directly translated into a differential equation as shown below.   Translating words into a differential equation       There are some key ideas that can be helpful when translating words into a differential equation. Any time we see something about rates or changes, we should think about derivatives. The word is usually corresponds to an equal sign in the equation. The words proportional to mean we have a constant multiplied by something.  The differential equation in Figure is easily solved using separation of variables. We find .  Notice that we need values for both and before we can use this formula to predict population size. We require information about the population at two different times in order to fully determine the population model.   Bacterial Growth   Suppose a population of e-coli bacteria grows at a rate proportional to the current population. If an initial popluation of 200 bacteria has grown to 1600 three hours later, find a function for the size of the population at time , and use it to predict when the population size will reach 10,000. bacterial growth     Video solution     We already know that the population at time is given by for some and . The information about the initial size of the population means that . Thus . Our knowledge of the population size after three hours allows us to solve for via the equation .  Solving this exponential equation yields . The popluation at time is given by .  Solving yields . The population is predicted to reach 10,000 bacteria in slightly more than five and a half hours.    Another example of porportional change is Newton's Law of Cooling. The laws of thermodynamics state that heat flows from areas of higher temperature to areas of lower temperature. A simple example is a hot object that cools down when placed in a cool room. Newton's Law of Cooling is the simple assumption that the temperature of the object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the ambient temperature of the room. If is the temperature of the object and is the constant ambient temperature, Newton's Law of Cooling can be expressed as the differential equation . Newton's Law of Cooling   This differential equation is both linear and separable. The separated form is .  Then an implicit definition of the temperature is given by .  If we solve for , we find the explicit temperature .  Though we didn't show the steps, the explicit solution involves the typical process of renaming the constant as , and allowing to be positive, negative, or zero to account for both cases of the absolution value and to catch the constant solution . Notice that the temperature of the object approaches the ambient temperature in the limit as .   The equation is also a valid representation of Newton's Law of Cooling. Intuition tells us that will increase if is less than and decrease if is greater then . The form we use in the text follows this intuition with a positive value. The form above will require that take on a negative value. In the end, both forms result in the same function.    Hot Coffee   A freshly brewed cup of coffee is set on the counter and has a temperature of 200 Fahrenheit. After 3 minutes, it has cooled to 190 , but is still too hot to drink. If the room is 72 and the coffee cools according to Newton's Law of Cooling, how long will the impatient coffee drinker have to wait until the coffee has cooled to 165 ?    Video solution     Since we have already solved the differential equation for Newton's Law of Cooling, we can immediately use the function .  Since the room is 72 , we know . The initial temperature is 200 , which means . At this point, we have   The information about the coffee cooling to 190 in 3 minutes leads to the equation .  Solving the exponential equation for , we have .  Finally, we finish the problem by solving the exponential equation .  The coffee drinker must wait minutes.    We finish our discussion of models of proportional change by exploring three different models of disease spread through a population. In all of the models, we let denote the proportion of the population that is sick ( ). We assume a proportion of is initially sick and that a proportion of is sick 1 week later.   Disease Spread 1   Suppose a disease spreads through a population at a rate proportional to the number of individuals who are sick. If 5% of the population is sick initially and 10% of the population is sick one week later, find a formula for the proportion of the popoulation that is sick at time .    The assumption here seems to have some merit because it matches our intuition that a disease should spread more rapidly when more individuals are sick. The differential equation is simply , with solution .  The conditions and lead to a and , so the function is .  We should point out a glaring problem with this model. The variable is a proportion and should take on values between 0 and 1, but the function grows without bound. After weeks, exceeds 1, and the model ceases to make physical sense.     Video presentation of Examples     Disease Spread 2   Suppose a disease spreads through a population at a rate proportional to the number of individuals who are not sick. If 5% of the population is sick initially and 10% of the population is sick one week later, find a formula for the proportion of the popoulation that is sick at time .    The intuition behind the assumption here is that a disease can only spread if there are individuals who are susceptible to the infection. As fewer and fewer people are able to be infected, the disease spread should slow down. Since is proportion of the population that is sick, is the proportion who are not sick, and the differential equation is .  Though the context is quite different, the differential equation is identical to the differential equation for Newton's Law of Cooling, with . The solution is .  The conditions and yield and , so the final function is .  Notice that this function approaches in the limit as , and does not suffer from the non-physical behavior described in Example .    In Example , we assumed disease spread depends on the number of infected individuals. In Example , we assumed disease spread depends on the number of susceptible individuals who are able to become infected. In reality, we would expect many diseases to require the interaction of both infected and susceptible individuals in order to spread. One of the simplest ways to model this required interaction is to assume disease spread depends on the product of the proportions of infected and uninfected individuals. This assumption (regularly seen in the context of chemical reactions) is often called the law of mass action.    Disease Spread 3   Suppose a disease spreads through a population at a rate proportional to the product of the number of infected and uninfected individuals. If 5% of the population is sick initially and 10% of the population is sick one week later, find a formula for the proportion of the population that is sick at time . differential equation logistic     Video solution     The differential equation is .  This is exactly the logistic equation with . We solved this differential equation in Example , and found .  The conditions and yield and . The final function is .  Based on the three different assumptions about the rate of disease spread explored in the last three examples, we now have three different functions giving the proportion of a population that is sick at time . Each of the three functions meets the conditions and . The three functions are shown in Figure .  Notice that the logistic function mimics specific parts of the functions from Examples and . We see in Figure that the logistic and exponential functions are virtually indistinguishable for small values. When there are few infected individuals and lots of susceptible individuals, the spread of a disease is largely determined by the number of sick people. The logistic curve captures this feature, and is almost exponential early on.  In Figure , we see that the logistic curve leaves the exponential curve from Example and approaches the curve from Example . This result implies that when most of the population is sick, the spread of the disease is largely dependent on the number of susceptible individuals. Though there are much more sophisticated mathematical models describing the spread of infections, we could argue that the logistic model presented in this example is the best of the three.   Plots of the functions from Example (dotted), Example (dashed), and Example (solid)                       Rate-in Rate-out Problems  One of the classic ways to build a mathematical model involves tracking the way the amount of something can change. We sometimes say these models are based on conservation laws . Consider a box with some amount of a specific type of material inside. (Some type of chemical, for example.) The amount of material of the specific type in the box can only change in four ways; we can add more to the box, we can remove some from the box, some of the material can change into material of a different type, or some other type of material can turn into the type we're tracking. In the examples that follow, we assume material doesn't change type, so we only need to keep track of material coming into the box and material leaving the box. To derive a differential equation, we track rates: .   Introduction to Rate-in Rate-out problems    Though we stick to relatively simple examples, this basic idea can be used to derive some very important differential equations in mathematics and physics.  The examples to follow involve tracking the amount of a chemical in solution. We assume liquid containing some chemical flows into a container at some rate. That liquid mixes instantaneously with the liquid already in the container. Then the liquid from the container flows out at some (potentially different) rate.   The assumption about instantaneous mixing, though not physically accurate, leads to a differential equation we have hope of solving. In reality, the amount of chemical at a specific location in the container depends both on the location and how long we have been waiting. This dependence on both space and time leads to a type of differential equation called a partial differential equation. Differential equations of this type are more interesting, but significantly harder to study. Instantaneous mixing removes any spatial dependence from the problem, and leaves us with an ordinary differential equation .    Equal Flow Rates   Suppose a 10 liter tank has 5 liters of salt solution in it. The initial concentration of the salt solution is 1 gram per liter. A salt solution with concentration 3 flows into the tank at a rate of 2 . Suppose the salt solution mixes instantaneously with the solution already in the tank, and that the mixed solution from the tank flows out at a rate of 2 . Find a function that gives the amount of salt in the tank at time .    Video solution     We use the rate in - rate out setup described above. The quantity here is the amount (in grams) of salt in the tank at time . Let denote the amount of salt. In words, the differential equation is given by .  Thinking in terms of units can help fill in the details of the differential equation. Since has units of grams, the left hand side of the equation has units g\/min. Both terms on the right hand side must have these same units. Notice that the product of a concentration (with units g\/L) and a flow rate (with units L\/min) results in a quantity with units g\/min. Both terms on the right hand side of the equation will include a concentration multiplied by a flow rate.  For the rate in, we multiply the inflow concentration by the rate that fluid is flowing into the bucket. This is g\/min.  The rate out is more complicated. The flow rate is still 2 , meaning that the overall volume of the fluid in the bucket is the constant 5 . The salt concentration in the bucket is not constant though, meaning that the outflow concentration is not constant. In particular, the outflow concentration is not the constant 1 . This is simply the initial concentration. To find the concentration at any time, we need the amount of salt in the bucket at that time and the volume of liquid in the bucket at that time. The volume of liquid is the constant 5 , and the amount of salt is given by the dependent variable . Thus, the outflow concentration is g\/L, yielding a rate out given by .  The differential equation we wish to solve is given by .  To furnish an initial condition, we must convert the initial salt concentration into an initial amount of salt. This is g, so is our initial condition.  Our differential equation is both separable and linear. We solve using separation of variables. The separated form of the differential equation is .  Integration yields the implicit solution .  Solving for (and redefining the arbitrary constant as necessary) yields the explicit solution .  The initial condition means that so that is the particular solution to our initial value problem.  This function is plotted in Figure . Notice that in the limit as , approaches . This corresponds to a bucket concentration of g\/L. It should not be surprising that salt concentration inside the tank will move to match the inflow salt concentration.   Salt concentration at time , from Example          Unequal Flow Rates   Suppose the setup is identical to the setup in Example except that now liquid flows out of the bucket at a rate of 1 L\/min. Find a function that gives the amount of salt in the bucket at time . What is the salt concentration when the solution ceases to be valid?    Video solution     Because the inflow and outflow rates no longer match, the volume of liquid in the bucket is not the constant 5 L. In general, we can find the volume of liquid via the equation .  In this example, the volume at time is liters. Because the total volume of the bucket is only 10 L, it follows that our solution will only be valid for . At that point it is no longer possible to have liquid flow into a the bucket at a rate of 2 L\/min and out of the bucket at a rate of 1 L\/min.  To update the differential equation, we must modify the rate out. Since the volume is , the concentration at time is given by g\/L. Thus for rate out, we must use g\/min. The initial value problem is .  Unlike Example , where we had equal flow rates, this differential equation is no longer separable. We must proceed with an integrating factor. Writing the differential equation in the form , we identify the integrating factor .  Then , yielding the implicit solution .  The initial condition implies , so the explicit solution to our initial value problem is given by .  This solution ceases to be valid at . At that time, there are 25 g of salt in the tank. The volume of liquid is 10 L, resulting in a salt concentration of g\/L.    Differential equations are powerful tools that can be used to help describe the world around us. Though relatively simple in concept, the ideas of proportional change and matching rates can serve as building blocks in the development of more sophisticated mathematical models. As we saw in this section, some simple mathematical models can be solved analytically using the techniques developed in this chapter. Most sophisticated mathematical models don't allow for analytic solutions. Even so, there are an array of graphical and numerical techniques that can be used to analyze the model to make predictions and infer information about real world phenomena.     Problems    In the following exercises, use the tools in the section to answer the questions presented.    Suppose the rate of change of with respect to is proportional to . Write down and solve a differential equation for .        A rumor is spreading through a middle school with 250 students. Suppose the rumor spreads at a rate proportional to the number of students who haven't heard the rumor yet. If 1 person starts the rumor, and 75 students have heard the rumor 3 days later, how many days will it take until 80% of the students in the school have heard the rumor?   13.66 days    A rumor is spreading through a middle school with 250 students. Suppose the rumor spreads at a rate proportional to the product of number of students who have heard the rumor and the number who haven't heard the rumor. If 1 person starts the rumor, and 75 students have heard the rumor 3 days later, how many days will it take until 80% of the students in the school have heard the rumor?   4.43 days    A feature of radioactive decay is that the amount of a radioactive substance decreases at a rate proportional to the current amount of the substance. The half life  half life of a substance is the amount of time it takes for half of a given amount of substance to decay. The half life of carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years. If an ancient object has a carbon-14 amount that is 20% of the original amount, how old is the object?   13,304.65 years old    Consider a chemical reaction where molecules of type A combine with molecules of type B to form molecules of type C. Suppose one molecule of type A combines with one molecule of type B to form one molecule of type C, and that type C is produced at a rate proportional the product of the remaining number of molecules of types A and B. Let denote moles of molecules of type . Find a function giving the number of moles of type C at time if there are originally moles of type A, moles of type B, and zero moles of type C.        Suppose an object with a temperature of 100 is introduced into a room with an ambient temperature of 70 . Suppose the temperature of the object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the room (Newton's Law of Cooling). If the object has cooled to 92 in 10 minutes, how long until the object has cooled to 84    24.57 minutes    Suppose an object with a temperature of 100 is introduced into a room with an ambient temperature given by degrees. Suppose the temperature of the object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the room (Newton's Law of Cooling). If the object is 80 after 20 minutes, find a formula giving the temperature of the object at time . (Note: This problem requires a numerical technique to solve for the unknown constants.)        A tank contains 5 gallons of salt solution with concentration 0.5 g\/gal. Pure water flows into the tank at a rate of 1 gallon per minute. Salt solution flows out of the tank at a rate of 1 gallon per minute. (Assume instantaneous mixing.) Find the concentration of the salt solution at 10 minutes.   0.06767 g\/gal    Dead leaves accumulate on the ground at a rate of 4 grams per square centimeter per year. The dead leaves on the ground decompose at a rate of 50% per year. Find a formula giving grams per square centimeter on the ground if there are no leaves on the ground at time .    g\/cm     A pond initially contains 10 million gallons of fresh water. Water containing an undesirable chemical flows into the pond at a rate of 5 million gallons per year, and fluid from the pond flows out at the same rate. (Assume instantaneous mixing.) If the concentration (in grams per million gallons) of the incoming chemical varies periodically according to the expression , find a formula giving the amount of chemical in the pond at time .    g    A large tank contains 1 gallon of a salt solution with concentration 2 g\/gal. A salt solution with concentration 1 g\/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 4 gal\/min. Salt solution flows out of the tank at a rate of 3 gal\/min. (Assume instantaneous mixing.) Find the amount of salt in the tank at 10 minutes.   11.00075 g    A stream flows into a pond containing 2 million gallons of fresh water at a rate of 1 million gallons per day. The stream flows out of the first pond and into a second pond containing 3 million gallons of fresh water. The stream then flows out of the second pond. Suppose the inflow and outflow rates are the same so that both ponds maintain their volumes. A factory upstream of the first pond starts polluting the stream. Directly below the factory, pollutant has a concentration of 55 grams per million gallons, and this concentration starts to flow into the first pond. Find the concentration of pollutant in the first and second ponds at 5 days.   pond 1: 50.4853 grams per million gallons  pond 2: 32.8649 grams per million gallons      "

  "body": " Sequences  We commonly refer to a set of events that occur one after the other as a sequence of events. In mathematics, we use the word sequence to refer to an ordered set of numbers, , a set of numbers that occur one after the other.    Video introduction to Section    For instance, the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, , form a sequence. The order is important; the first number is 2, the second is 4, etc. It seems natural to seek a formula that describes a given sequence, and often this can be done. For instance, the sequence above could be described by the function , for the values of To find the th term in the sequence, we would compute . This leads us to the following, formal definition of a sequence.   Sequence   A sequence is a function whose domain is . The range of a sequence is the set of all distinct values of . sequences definition   The terms of a sequence are the values , , , which are usually denoted with subscripts as , , .  A sequence is often denoted as .      Notation: We use to describe the set of natural numbers, that is, the positive integers      A factorial refers to the product of a descending sequence of natural numbers. For example, the expression (read as factorial) refers to the number . factorial  aa@   In general, , where is a natural number.  We define . While this does not immediately make sense, it makes many mathematical formulas work properly.     Listing terms of a sequence   List the first four terms of the following sequences.             Video solution              We can plot the terms of a sequence with a scatter plot. The horizontal axis is used for the values of , and the values of the terms are plotted on the vertical axis. To visualize this sequence, see Figure .   Plotting the sequence in               .  Note that the range of this sequence is finite, consisting of only the values 3 and 5. This sequence is plotted in Figure .   Plotting the sequence in               ; .  We gave one extra term to begin to show the pattern of signs is , , , , , , , due to the fact that the exponent of is a special quadratic. This sequence is plotted in Figure .   Plotting the sequence in                Determining a formula for a sequence   Find the th term of the following sequences, , find a function that describes each of the given sequences.                            Video solution     We should first note that there is never exactly one function that describes a finite set of numbers as a sequence. There are many sequences that start with 2, then 5, as our first example does. We are looking for a simple formula that describes the terms given, knowing there is possibly more than one answer.     Note how each term is 3 more than the previous one. This implies a linear function would be appropriate: for some appropriate value of . If we were to think in terms of ordered pairs, they would be of the form . So one such ordered pair would be . As we want , we set . Thus .    First notice how the sign changes from term to term. This is most commonly accomplished by multiplying the terms by either or . Using multiplies the odd indexed terms by . Thus the first term would be negative and the second term would be positive. Multiplying by multiplies the even indexed terms by . Thus the second term would be negative and the first term would be positive. As this sequence has negative even indexed terms, we will multiply by .  After this, we might feel a bit stuck as to how to proceed. At this point, we are just looking for a pattern of some sort: what do the numbers 2, 5, 10, 17, etc., have in common? There are many correct answers, but the one that we'll use here is that each is one more than a perfect square. That is, , , , etc. Thus our formula is .    One who is familiar with the factorial function will readily recognize these numbers. They are , , , , etc. Since our sequences start with , we cannot write , for this misses the term. Instead, we shift by 1, and write .    This one may appear difficult, especially as the first two terms are the same, but a little sleuthing will help. Notice how the terms in the numerator are always multiples of 5, and the terms in the denominator are always powers of 2. Does something as simple as work?  When , we see that we indeed get as desired. When , we get . Further checking shows that this formula indeed matches the other terms of the sequence.       A common mathematical endeavor is to create a new mathematical object (for instance, a sequence) and then apply previously known mathematics to the new object. We do so here. The fundamental concept of calculus is the limit, so we will investigate what it means to find the limit of a sequence.   Limit of a Sequence, Convergent, Divergent   Let be a sequence and let be a real number. Given any , if an can be found such that for all , then we say the limit of , as  approaches infinity , is , denoted .  If exists, we say the sequence converges ; otherwise, the sequence diverges . limit of sequence  sequences limit  convergence of sequence  divergence of sequence  sequences convergent  sequences divergent     This definition states, informally, that if the limit of a sequence is , then if you go far enough out along the sequence, all subsequent terms will be really close to . Of course, the terms far enough and really close are subjective terms, but hopefully the intent is clear.   Video presentation of    This definition is reminiscent of the - proofs of Chapter . In that chapter we developed other tools to evaluate limits apart from the formal definition; we do so here as well.   Limit of Infinity, Divergent Sequence   Let be a sequence. We say if for all , there exists a number such that if , then . In this case, we say the sequence diverges to .    This definition states, informally, that if the limit of is , then you can guarantee that the terms of will get arbitrarily large (larger than any value of that you think of), by going out far enough in the sequence.   Limit of a Sequence   Let be a sequence, let be a real number, and let be a function whose domain contains the positive real numbers where for all in .     If , then .    If , then .        Theorem allows us, in certain cases, to apply the tools developed in Chapter to limits of sequences. Note two things not stated by the theorem:     If does not exist, we cannot conclude that does not exist. It may, or may not, exist. For instance, we can define a sequence . Let . Since the cosine function oscillates over the real numbers, the limit does not exist. However, for every positive integer , , so .    If we cannot find a function whose domain contains the positive real numbers where for all in , we cannot conclude does not exist. It may, or may not, exist.      Determining convergence\/divergence of a sequence   Determine the convergence or divergence of the following sequences.               Video solution        Using Theorem , we can state that . (We could have also directly applied L'Hospital's Rule.) Thus the sequence converges, and its limit is 3. A scatter plot of every 5 values of is given in Figure . The values of vary widely near , ranging from about to , but as grows, the values approach 3.   Scatter plot for the sequence in           The limit does not exist, as oscillates (and takes on every value in infinitely many times). Thus we cannot apply Theorem . The fact that the cosine function oscillates strongly hints that , when is restricted to , will also oscillate. Figure , where the sequence is plotted, shows that this is true. Because only discrete values of cosine are plotted, it does not bear strong resemblance to the familiar cosine wave. The proof of the following statement is beyond the scope of this text, but it is true: there are infinitely many integers that are arbitrarily ( , very ) close to an even multiple of , so that . Similarly, there are infinitely many integers that are arbitrarily close to an odd multiple of , so that . As the sequence takes on values near 1 and infinitely many times, we conclude that does not exist.   Scatter plot for the sequence in           We cannot actually apply Theorem here, as the function is not well defined. (What does mean? In actuality, there is an answer, but it involves complex analysis , beyond the scope of this text.) Instead, we invoke the definition of the limit of a sequence. By looking at the plot in Figure , we would like to conclude that the sequence converges to . Let be given. We can find a natural number such that . Let , and consider : . We have shown that by picking large enough, we can ensure that is arbitrarily close to our limit, , hence by the definition of the limit of a sequence, we can say .   Scatter plot for the sequence in              In the previous example we used the definition of the limit of a sequence to determine the convergence of a sequence as we could not apply Theorem . In general, we like to avoid invoking the definition of a limit, and the following theorem gives us tool that we could use in that example instead.   Absolute Value Theorem   Let be a sequence. If , then  Absolute Value Theorem  limit Absolute Value Theorem  sequence Absolute Value Theorem     Let . We start by noting that . If we apply limits to this inequality: We conclude that the only possible answer for is .     Determining the convergence\/divergence of a sequence   Determine the convergence or divergence of the following sequences.                 This appeared in Example . We want to apply Theorem , so consider the limit of : . Since this limit is 0, we can apply Theorem and state that .    Because of the alternating nature of this sequence ( , every other term is multiplied by ), we cannot simply look at the limit . We can try to apply the techniques of Theorem : . We have concluded that when we ignore the alternating sign, the sequence approaches 1. This means we cannot apply Theorem ; it states the the limit must be 0 in order to conclude anything.   A plot of a sequence in Example , part 2         Since we know that the signs of the terms alternate and we know that the limit of is 1, we know that as approaches infinity, the terms will alternate between values close to 1 and , meaning the sequence diverges. A plot of this sequence is given in Figure .       We continue our study of the limits of sequences by considering some of the properties of these limits.   Properties of the Limits of Sequences   Let and be sequences such that , , and let be a real number.       sequences limit properties           ,              Video presentation of and     Applying properties of limits of sequences   Let the following sequences, and their limits, be given:      , and ;     , and ; and     , and .     Evaluate the following limits.           Video solution     We will use Theorem to answer each of these.     Since and , we conclude that . So even though we are adding something to each term of the sequence , we are adding something so small that the final limit is the same as before.    Since and , we conclude that .    Since , we have . It does not matter that we multiply each term by 1000; the sequence still approaches 0. (It just takes longer to get close to 0.)       There is more to learn about sequences than just their limits. We will also study their range and the relationships terms have with the terms that follow. We start with some definitions describing properties of the range.   Bounded and Unbounded Sequences   A sequence is said to be bounded if there exist real numbers and such that for all in . The number is called a lower bound for the sequence, and the number is called an upper bound for the sequence.  A sequence is said to be unbounded if it is not bounded.  A sequence is said to be bounded above if there exists an such that for all in ; it is bounded below if there exists an such that for all in . sequences boundedness  bounded sequence  unbounded sequence     It follows from this definition that an unbounded sequence may be bounded above or bounded below; a sequence that is both bounded above and below is simply a bounded sequence.   Determining boundedness of sequences   Determine the boundedness of the following sequences.          Video solution        The terms of this sequence are always positive but are decreasing, so we have for all . Thus this sequence is bounded. Figure illustrates this.    The terms of this sequence obviously grow without bound. However, it is also true that these terms are all positive, meaning . Thus we can say the sequence is unbounded, but also bounded below. Figure illustrates this.      A plot of and from Example                         The previous example produces some interesting concepts. First, we can recognize that the sequence converges to 0. This says, informally, that most of the terms of the sequence are really close to 0. This implies that the sequence is bounded, using the following logic. First, most terms are near 0, so we could find some sort of bound on these terms (using Definition , the bound is ). That leaves a few terms that are not near 0 ( , a finite number of terms). A finite list of numbers is always bounded.  This logic implies that if a sequence converges, it must be bounded. This is indeed true, as stated by the following theorem.   Convergent Sequences are Bounded   Let be a convergent sequence. Then is bounded. bounded sequence convergence  convergence of sequence  sequences convergent      Keep in mind what Theorem does not say. It does not say that bounded sequences must converge, nor does it say that if a sequence does not converge, it is not bounded.    Video presentation of    In Example we saw the sequence , where it was stated that . (Note that this is simply restating part of Theorem . The limit can also be found using logarithms and L'Hospital's rule.) Even though it may be difficult to intuitively grasp the behavior of this sequence, we know immediately that it is bounded.  Another interesting concept to come out of Example again involves the sequence . We stated, without proof, that the terms of the sequence were decreasing. That is, that for all . (This is easy to show. Clearly . Taking reciprocals flips the inequality: . This is the same as .) Sequences that either steadily increase or decrease are important, so we give this property a name.   Monotonic Sequences      A sequence is monotonically increasing if for all , ,     A sequence is monotonically decreasing if for all , ,     A sequence is monotonic if it is monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing. sequences monotonic  monotonic sequence         It is sometimes useful to call a monotonically increasing sequence strictly increasing if for all ; i.e, we remove the possibility that subsequent terms are equal.  A similar statement holds for strictly decreasing.     Video presentation of and     Determining monotonicity   Determine the monotonicity of the following sequences.                            Video solution     In each of the following, we will examine . If , we conclude that and hence the sequence is increasing. If , we conclude that and the sequence is decreasing. Of course, a sequence need not be monotonic and perhaps neither of the above will apply.  We also give a scatter plot of each sequence. These are useful as they suggest a pattern of monotonicity, but analytic work should be done to confirm a graphical trend.      Since for all , we conclude that the sequence is decreasing.     Since for all , we conclude the sequence is increasing.    We can clearly see in Figure , where the sequence is plotted, that it is not monotonic. However, it does seem that after the first 4 terms it is decreasing. To understand why, perform the same analysis as done before: .  We want to know when this is greater than, or less than, 0. The denominator is always positive, therefore we are only concerned with the numerator. For small values of , the numerator is positive. As grows large, the numerator is dominated by , meaning the entire fraction will be negative; , for large enough , . Using the quadratic formula we can determine that the numerator is negative for . In short, the sequence is simply not monotonic, though it is useful to note that for , the sequence is monotonically decreasing.    Again, the plot in Figure shows that the sequence is not monotonic, but it suggests that it is monotonically decreasing after the first term. We perform the usual analysis to confirm this. When , the above expression is ; for , the above expression is . Thus this sequence is not monotonic, but it is monotonically decreasing after the first term.      Plots of sequences in Example                                                 Knowing that a sequence is monotonic can be useful. Consider, for example, a sequence that is monotonically decreasing and is bounded below. We know the sequence is always getting smaller, but that there is a bound to how small it can become. This is enough to prove that the sequence will converge, as stated in the following theorem.   Bounded Monotonic Sequences are Convergent      Let be a monotonically increasing sequence that is bounded above. Then converges.    Let be a monotonically decreasing sequence that is bounded below. Then converges. sequences convergent  convergence of monotonic sequences        Consider once again the sequence . It is easy to show it is monotonically decreasing and that it is always positive ( , bounded below by 0). Therefore we can conclude by Theorem that the sequence converges. We already knew this by other means, but in the following section this theorem will become very useful.  We can replace Theorem with the statement Let be a bounded, monotonic sequence. Then converges; , exists. We leave it to the reader in the exercises to show the theorem and the above statement are equivalent.   Finding the limit of a bounded, monotonic sequence    Sequences are a great source of mathematical inquiry. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences ( ) contains thousands of sequences and their formulae. (As of this writing, there are 328,977 sequences in the database.) Perusing this database quickly demonstrates that a single sequence can represent several different real life phenomena.  Interesting as this is, our interest actually lies elsewhere. We are more interested in the sum of a sequence. That is, given a sequence , we are very interested in . Of course, one might immediately counter with Doesn't this just add up to infinity ? Many times, yes, but there are many important cases where the answer is no. This is the topic of series , which we begin to investigate in Section .

The fact that the cosine function oscillates strongly hints that , when is restricted to , will also oscillate. Figure , where the sequence is plotted, shows that this is true. Because only discrete values of cosine are plotted, it does not bear strong resemblance to the familiar cosine wave. The proof of the following statement is beyond the scope of this text, but it is true: there are infinitely many integers that are arbitrarily ( , very ) close to an even multiple of , so that . Similarly, there are infinitely many integers that are arbitrarily close to an odd multiple of , so that . As the sequence takes on values near 1 and infinitely many times, we conclude that does not exist.

If , we conclude that and hence the sequence is increasing. If , we conclude that and the sequence is decreasing. Of course, a sequence need not be monotonic and perhaps neither of the above will apply.  We also give a scatter plot of each sequence. These are useful as they suggest a pattern of monotonicity, but analytic work should be done to confirm a graphical trend.      Since for all , we conclude that the sequence is decreasing.     Since for all , we conclude the sequence is increasing.    We can clearly see in Figure , where the sequence is plotted, that it is not monotonic. However, it does seem that after the first 4 terms it is decreasing. To understand why, perform the same analysis as done before: .  We want to know when this is greater than, or less than, 0. The denominator is always positive, therefore we are only concerned with the numerator. For small values of , the numerator is positive. As grows large, the numerator is dominated by , meaning the entire fraction will be negative; , for large enough , . Using the quadratic formula we can determine that the numerator is negative for . In short, the sequence is simply not monotonic, though it is useful to note that for , the sequence is monotonically decreasing.    Again, the plot in Figure shows that the sequence is not monotonic, but it suggests that it is monotonically decreasing after the first term. We perform the usual analysis to confirm this. When , the above expression is ; for , the above expression is . Thus this sequence is not monotonic, but it is monotonically decreasing after the first term.

This limit can be interpreted as saying something amazing: the sum of all the terms of the sequence is 1.   This example illustrates some interesting concepts that we explore in this section. We begin this exploration with some definitions.    Convergence of sequences   Infinite Series, th Partial Sums, Convergence, Divergence   Let be a sequence, beginning at some index value .     The sum is called an infinite series (or, simply series ).    Let denote the sum of the first terms in the sequence , known as the th partial sum of the sequence. We can then define the sequence of partial sums of .    If the sequence converges to , we say the series  converges to , and we write .    If the sequence diverges, the series  diverges . series definition  series partial sums  series convergent  series divergent  convergence of series  divergence of series        Using our new terminology, we can state that the series converges, and .  Note that in the definition above, we do not necessarily assume that our sum begins with . In fact, it is quite common to have a series beginning at , and in some cases we may need to consider other values as well. The th partial sum will always denote the sum of the first terms: For example, has , while has , and has . In general, for the series , the th partial sum will be .  We will explore a variety of series in this section. We start with two series that diverge, showing how we might discern divergence.   Showing series diverge      Let . Show diverges.    Let . Show diverges.       Video solution        Consider , the th partial sum. . Since , we conclude that the series diverges. It is instructive to write for this tells us how the series diverges: it grows without bound. A scatter plot of the sequences and is given in Figure . The terms of are growing, so the terms of the partial sums are growing even faster, illustrating that the series diverges.    The sequence starts with 1, , 1, , . Consider some of the partial sums of : This pattern repeats; we find that . As oscillates, repeating 1, 0, 1, 0, , we conclude that does not exist, hence diverges. A scatter plot of the sequence and the partial sums is given in Figure . When is odd, so the marks for are drawn oversized to show they coincide.   Scatter plots relating to Example                            While it is important to recognize when a series diverges, we are generally more interested in the series that converge. In this section we will demonstrate a few general techniques for determining convergence; later sections will delve deeper into this topic.    Geometric Series  One important type of series is a geometric series .   Geometric Series   A geometric series is a series of the form   Note that the index starts at , not . series geometric  geometric series     We started this section with a geometric series, although we dropped the first term of . One reason geometric series are important is that they have nice convergence properties.   Geometric Series Test   Consider the geometric series .     For , the th partial sum is: . When , .    The series converges if, and only if, . When , series geometric  geometric series  convergence of geometric series  divergence of geometric series  .       We begin by proving the formula for the simplied form for the partial sums. Consider the th partial sum of the geometric series, : . We have shown Part of .  Now, examining the partial sums, we consider five cases to determine when converges:   If , then as , so we have , a convergent sequence of partial sums.    If , then as , so diverges to infinity. (Note that is a positive constant.)    If , then will oscillate between large positive and large negative values as increases. The same will be true of , so does not exist.   If , then is undefined. However, examining for , we can see that the partial sums simplify to , and this sequence diverges to .  If , then . For even values of , the partial sums are always . For odd values of , the partial sums are always . So the sequence of partial sums diverges.  Therefore, a geometric series converges if and only if .     Video presentation of and    According to Theorem , the series converges as , and . This concurs with our introductory example; while there we got a sum of 1, we skipped the first term of 1.   Exploring geometric series   Check the convergence of the following series. If the series converges, find its sum.                       Video solution        Since , this series converges. By Theorem , we have that . However, note the subscript of the summation in the given series: we are to start with . Therefore we subtract off the first two terms, giving: . This is illustrated in Figure .   Scatter plots for the series in           Since , this series converges, and by Theorem , . The partial sums of this series are plotted in Figure . Note how the partial sums are not purely increasing as some of the terms of the sequence are negative.   Scatter plots for the series in           Since , the series diverges. (This makes common sense ; we expect the sum to diverge.) This is illustrated in Figure .   Scatter plots for the series in                -Series  Another important type of series is the p-series .   -Series, General -Series      A -series is a series of the form     A general -series is a series of the form series p@ -series  p@ -series  p@ -series  , where and are real numbers such that and for all .       Like geometric series, one of the nice things about p-series is that they have easy to determine convergence properties.   -Series Test   A general -series will converge if, and only if, . series p@ -series  p@ -series  convergence of p@of -series  divergence of p@of -series      We will be able to prove Theorem in Section . This theorem assumes that for all ; if , won't be defined when is not an integer, and if for some , then of course the series does not converge regardless of as not all of the terms of the sequence are defined. These requirements actually force us to have , since if , we'll have for sufficiently large .    Determining convergence of series   Determine the convergence of the following series.                                      Video solution        This is a -series with . By Theorem , this series diverges. This series is a famous series, called the Harmonic Series , so named because of its relationship to harmonics in the study of music and sound.    This is a -series with . By Theorem , it converges. Note that the theorem does not give a formula by which we can determine what the series converges to; we just know it converges. A famous, unexpected result is that this series converges to .    This is a -series with ; the theorem states that it diverges.    This is not a -series; the definition does not allow for alternating signs. Therefore we cannot apply Theorem . (Another famous result states that this series, the Alternating Harmonic Series , converges to .)    This is a general -series with , therefore it converges.    This is not a -series, but a geometric series with . It converges.       Later sections will provide tests by which we can determine whether or not a given series converges. This, in general, is much easier than determining what a given series converges to. There are many cases, though, where the sum can be determined.   Telescoping series   Evaluate the sum . series telescoping  telescoping series     Video solution     It will help to write down some of the first few partial sums of this series.   Note how most of the terms in each partial sum are canceled out! In general, we see that . The sequence converges, as , and so we conclude that . Partial sums of the series are plotted in Figure .   Scatter plots relating to the series of Example           The series in Example is an example of a telescoping series . Informally, a telescoping series is one in which most terms cancel with preceding or following terms, reducing the number of terms in each partial sum. The partial sum did not contain terms, but rather just two: 1 and . series telescoping  telescoping series   When possible, seek a way to write an explicit formula for the th partial sum . This makes evaluating the limit much more approachable. We do so in the next example.   Evaluating series   Evaluate each of the following infinite series.                  Video solution        We can decompose the fraction as . (See Section , Partial Fraction Decomposition, to recall how this is done, if necessary.) Expressing the terms of is now more instructive: We again have a telescoping series. In each partial sum, most of the terms cancel and we obtain the formula . Taking limits allows us to determine the convergence of the series: , so . This is illustrated in Figure .    We begin by writing the first few partial sums of the series: At first, this does not seem helpful, but recall the logarithmic identity: . Applying this to gives: . We can conclude that . This sequence does not converge, as . Therefore ; the series diverges. Note in Figure how the sequence of partial sums grows slowly; after 100 terms, it is not yet over 5. Graphically we may be fooled into thinking the series converges, but our analysis above shows that it does not.      Scatter plots relating to the series in Example                         We are learning about a new mathematical object, the series. As done before, we apply old mathematics to this new topic.   Properties of Infinite Series   Let , , and let be a constant.     Constant Multiple Rule: . Constant Multiple Rule of series     Sum\/Difference Rule: . series properties  Sum\/Difference Rule of series        Before using this theorem, we provide a few famous series.   Important Series      . (Note that the index starts with .)     .     .     .     diverges. (This is called the Harmonic Series .) Harmonic Series      . (This is called the Alternating Harmonic Series .) Alternating Harmonic Series        Evaluating series   Evaluate the given series.                       Video solution        We start by using algebra to break the series apart: . This is illustrated in Figure .    This looks very similar to the series that involves in Key Idea . Note, however, that the series given in this example starts with and not . The first term of the series in the Key Idea is , so we will subtract this from our result below: . This is illustrated in Figure . The graph shows how this particular series converges very rapidly.   Scatter plots relating to the series in Example                         The denominators in each term are perfect squares; we are adding (note we start with , not ). This series will converge. Using the formula from Key Idea , we have the following:        It may take a while before one is comfortable with this statement, whose truth lies at the heart of the study of infinite series: it is possible that the sum of an infinite list of nonzero numbers is finite. We have seen this repeatedly in this section, yet it still may take some getting used to.   As one contemplates the behavior of series, a few facts become clear.     In order to add an infinite list of nonzero numbers and get a finite result, most of those numbers must be very near 0.    If a series diverges, it means that the sum of an infinite list of numbers is not finite (it may approach or it may oscillate), and:     The series will still diverge if the first term is removed.    The series will still diverge if the first 10 terms are removed.    The series will still diverge if the first terms are removed.    The series will still diverge if any finite number of terms from anywhere in the series are removed.        These concepts are very important and lie at the heart of the next two theorems.   th-Term Test for Divergence   Consider the series . If , then diverges. series nth@ th-term test  nth@ th-term test  convergence nth@ th-term test  divergence nth@ th-term test      Important! This theorem does not state that if then converges. The standard example of this is the Harmonic Series, as given in Key Idea . The Harmonic Sequence, , converges to 0; the Harmonic Series, , diverges.  Looking back, we can apply this theorem to the series in Example . In that example, the th terms of both sequences do not converge to 0, therefore we can quickly conclude that each series diverges.  One can rewrite Theorem to state If a series converges, then the underlying sequence converges to 0. While it is important to understand the truth of this statement, in practice it is rarely used. It is generally far easier to prove the convergence of a sequence than the convergence of a series.   Infinite Nature of Series   The convergence or divergence of an infinite series remains unchanged by the addition or subtraction of any finite number of terms. That is:     A divergent series will remain divergent with the addition or subtraction of any finite number of terms.    A convergent series will remain convergent with the addition or subtraction of any finite number of terms. (Of course, the sum will likely change.)       Consider once more the Harmonic Series which diverges; that is, the sequence of partial sums grows (very, very slowly) without bound. One might think that by removing the large terms of the sequence that perhaps the series will converge. This is simply not the case. For instance, the sum of the first 10 million terms of the Harmonic Series is about 16.7. Removing the first 10 million terms from the Harmonic Series changes the th partial sums, effectively subtracting 16.7 from the sum. However, a sequence that is growing without bound will still grow without bound when 16.7 is subtracted from it.  The equations below illustrate this. The first line shows the infinite sum of the Harmonic Series split into the sum of the first 10 million terms plus the sum of everything else. The next equation shows us subtracting these first 10 million terms from both sides. The final equation employs a bit of psuedo-math : subtracting 16.7 from infinity still leaves one with infinity.  .  Just for fun, we can show that the Harmonic Series diverges algebraically (without the use of ).   Divergence of the harmonic series  If you just consider the partial sums , it is not apparent that the partial sums diverge. Indeed they do diverge, but very, very slowly. (If you graph them on a logarithmic scale however, you can clearly see the divergence of the partial sums.) Instead, we will consider the partial sums, indexed by powers of . That is, we will consider .   Next, we consider grouping together terms in each partial sum. We will use these groupings to set up inequalities.   In the partial sum , we note that since , we can say . Do the same in and also note that every term in the group is larger than . So   Generally, we can see that . (In order to really show this, we should employ proof by induction.) Since the sequence of partial sums clearly diverges, so does the series .   This section introduced us to series and defined a few special types of series whose convergence properties are well known: we know when a -series or a geometric series converges or diverges. Most series that we encounter are not one of these types, but we are still interested in knowing whether or not they converge. The next three sections introduce tests that help us determine whether or not a given series converges.     Terms and Concepts   Use your own words to describe how sequences and series are related.   Answers will vary.    Use your own words to define a partial sum .   Answers will vary.    Given a series , describe the two sequences related to the series that are important.

With partial fractions, . Thus .    Converges to 3\/4.                   Converges to ..       Break the Harmonic Series into the sum of the odd and even terms: .  The goal is to show that each of the series on the right diverge.     Show why . (Compare each th partial sum.)    Show why     Explain why (a) and (b) demonstrate that the series of odd terms is convergent, if, and only if, the series of even terms is also convergent. (That is, show both converge or both diverge.)    Explain why knowing the Harmonic Series is divergent determines that the even and odd series are also divergent.         The th partial sum of the odd series is . The th partial sum of the even series is . Each term of the even series is less than the corresponding term of the odd series, giving us our result.    The th partial sum of the odd series is . The th partial sum of 1 plus the even series is . Each term of the even series is now greater than or equal to the corresponding term of the odd series, with equality only on the first term. This gives us the result.    If the odd series converges, the work done in (a) shows the even series converges also. (The sequence of the th partial sum of the even series is bounded and monotonically increasing.) Likewise, (b) shows that if the even series converges, the odd series will, too. Thus if either series converges, the other does. Similarly, (a) and (b) can be used to show that if either series diverges, the other does, too.    If both the even and odd series converge, then their sum would be a convergent series. This would imply that the Harmonic Series, their sum, is convergent. It is not. Hence each series diverges.       Show the series diverges.   Using partial fractions, we can show that . The series is effectively twice the sum of the odd terms of the Harmonic Series which was shown to diverge in Exercise . Thus this series diverges.      "

We begin by writing the first few partial sums of the series: At first, this does not seem helpful, but recall the logarithmic identity: . Applying this to gives: . We can conclude that . This sequence does not converge, as . Therefore ; the series diverges. Note in Figure how the sequence of partial sums grows slowly; after 100 terms, it is not yet over 5.

Theorems and give criteria for when Geometric and -series converge, and Theorem gives a quick test to determine if a series diverges. There are many important series whose convergence cannot be determined by these theorems, though, so we introduce a set of tests that allow us to handle a broad range of series. We start with the Integral Test.    Integral Test  We stated in Section that a sequence is a function whose domain is , the set of natural numbers. If we can extend to , the real numbers, and it is both positive and decreasing on , then the convergence of is the same as .   Integral Test   Let a sequence be defined by , where is continuous, positive and decreasing on . Then converges, if, and only if, converges. series Integral Test  Integral Test  convergence Integral Test  divergence Integral Test       Theorem does not state that the integral and the summation have the same value.    Video presentation of    We can demonstrate the truth of the Integral Test with two simple graphs. In Figure , the height of each rectangle is for , and clearly the rectangles enclose more area than the area under . Therefore we can conclude that .   Illustrating the truth of the Integral Test                       In Figure , we draw rectangles under with the Right-Hand rule, starting with . This time, the area of the rectangles is less than the area under , so . Note how this summation starts with ; adding to both sides lets us rewrite the summation starting with : .  Combining Equations and , we have .  From Equation we can make the following two statements:     If diverges, so does (because )    If converges, so does (because .)     Therefore the series and integral either both converge or both diverge. Theorem allows us to extend this theorem to series where is positive and decreasing on for some . A formal proof of the is shown below.   Proof of the Integral Test  Let be a postive, continuous, decreasing function on . We will consider how the partial sums of compare to the integral . We first consider the case where diverges.     Suppose that diverges. Using Figure , we can say that . If we let in this inequality, we know that will get arbitrarily large as (since and diverges). Therefore we conclude that will also get arbitrarily large as , and thus diverges.    Now suppose that converges to , where is some positive, finite number. Using Figure , we can say that . Therefore our sequence of partial sums, is bounded. Furthermore, is a monotonically increasing sequence since all of the terms are positive. Since is both bounded and monotonic, converges by and by Definition , the series converges as well.       Using the Integral Test   Determine the convergence of . (The terms of the sequence and the th partial sums are given in Figure .)    Video solution      Figure implies that is positive and decreasing on . We can determine this analytically, too. We know is positive as both and are positive on . Treating as a continuous function of defined on , consider , which is negative for . Since is negative, is decreasing for . We can still use the integral test since a finite number of terms will not affect convergence of the series.   Plotting the sequence and series in Example         Applying the Integral Test, we test the convergence of . Integrating this improper integral requires the use of Integration by Parts, with and . .  Since converges, so does .     Theorem was given without justification, stating that the general -series converges if, and only if, . In the following example, we prove this to be true by applying the Integral Test.   Using the Integral Test to establish Theorem   Let be real numbers such that and for all .

It is easy to show that the integral also diverges in the case of . (This result is similar to the work preceding Key Idea .)  Therefore converges if, and only if, .    We consider two more convergence tests in this section, both comparison tests. That is, we determine the convergence of one series by comparing it to another series with known convergence.    Direct Comparison Test   Direct Comparison Test   Let and be positive sequences where for all , for some . series Direct Comparison Test  Direct Comparison Test for series  convergence Direct Comparison Test  divergence Direct Comparison Test      If converges, then converges.    If diverges, then diverges.       Let for all . Note that both partial sums for both series are positive and increasing since the terms of both sequences are positive.     Suppose that converges, so , where is a finite, positive number. ( must be positive since .)  Comparing the partial sums, we must have since for all . Furthermore since converges to , our partial sums for are bounded (note that the partial sums started at , but a finite number of terms will not affect the boundedness of the partial sums). . Since the sequence of partial sums, is both monotonically increasing and bounded, we can say that converges (by ), and therefore so does .    Suppose that diverges, so . (We can say that the series diverges to since the terms of the series are always positive). Comparing the partial sums, we have Then applying limits, we get . Since the limit on the left side diverges to , we can say that also diverges to .        A sequence is a positive sequence if for all .  Because of Theorem , any theorem that relies on a positive sequence still holds true when for all but a finite number of values of . sequence positive     Video presentation of     Applying the Direct Comparison Test   Determine the convergence of .    Video solution     This series is neither a geometric or -series, but seems related. We predict it will converge, so we look for a series with larger terms that converges. (Note too that the Integral Test seems difficult to apply here.)  Since , for all . The series is a convergent geometric series; by Theorem , converges.     Applying the Direct Comparison Test   Determine the convergence of .    Video solution     We know the Harmonic Series diverges, and it seems that the given series is closely related to it, hence we predict it will diverge.  Since for all , for all .  The Harmonic Series diverges, so we conclude that diverges as well.    The concept of direct comparison is powerful and often relatively easy to apply. Practice helps one develop the necessary intuition to quickly pick a proper series with which to compare. However, it is easy to construct a series for which it is difficult to apply the Direct Comparison Test.  Consider . It is very similar to the divergent series given in Example . We suspect that it also diverges, as for large . However, the inequality that we naturally want to use goes the wrong way : since for all , for all . The given series has terms less than the terms of a divergent series, and we cannot conclude anything from this.  Fortunately, we can apply another test to the given series to determine its convergence.   Motivating      Limit Comparison Test   Limit Comparison Test   Let and be positive sequences. series Limit Comparison Test  Limit Comparison Test for series  convergence Limit Comparison Test  divergence Limit Comparison Test      If , where is a positive real number, then and either both converge or both diverge.    If , then if converges, then so does .    If , then if diverges, then so does .        Theorem is most useful when the convergence of the series from is known and we are trying to determine the convergence of the series from .   Video presentation of    We use the Limit Comparison Test in the next example to examine the series which motivated this new test.   Applying the Limit Comparison Test   Determine the convergence of using the Limit Comparison Test.    Video solution     We compare the terms of to the terms of the Harmonic Sequence : .  Since the Harmonic Series diverges, we conclude that diverges as well.     Applying the Limit Comparison Test   Determine the convergence of     Video solution     This series is similar to the one in Example , but now we are considering instead of . This difference makes applying the Direct Comparison Test difficult.  Instead, we use the Limit Comparison Test and compare with the series : .  We know is a convergent geometric series, hence converges as well.    As mentioned before, practice helps one develop the intuition to quickly choose a series with which to compare. A general rule of thumb is to pick a series based on the dominant term in the expression of . It is also helpful to note that factorials dominate exponentials, which dominate algebraic functions (e.g., polynomials), which dominate logarithms. In the previous example, the dominant term of was , so we compared the series to . It is hard to apply the Limit Comparison Test to series containing factorials, though, as we have not learned how to apply L'Hospital's Rule to .   Applying the Limit Comparison Test   Determine the convergence of .    Video solution     We naïvely attempt to apply the rule of thumb given above and note that the dominant term in the expression of the series is . Knowing that converges, we attempt to apply the Limit Comparison Test: .   Theorem part (3) only applies when diverges; in our case, it converges. Ultimately, our test has not revealed anything about the convergence of our series.  The problem is that we chose a poor series with which to compare. Since the numerator and denominator of the terms of the series are both algebraic functions, we should have compared our series to the dominant term of the numerator divided by the dominant term of the denominator.  The dominant term of the numerator is and the dominant term of the denominator is . Thus we should compare the terms of the given series to : .  Since the -series converges, we conclude that converges as well.    We mentioned earlier that the Integral Test did not work well with series containing factorial terms. The next section introduces the Ratio Test, which does handle such series well. We also introduce the Root Test, which is good for series where each term is raised to a power.     Terms and Concepts   In order to apply the Integral Test to a sequence , the function must be , and .   continuous, positive and decreasing    T\/F: The Integral Test can be used to determine the sum of a convergent series.

What property must have? See if you can interpret in terms of left and right handed Riemann sums.   Since the Integral Test applies, we know that must be a decreasing function. The sum can be viewed as a right-endpoint Riemann sum for the integral , and this must be an underestimate, since is a decreasing function. But can also be viewed as a left-endpoint Riemann sum for the integral , and this must be an overestimate.   Estimate the error involved in using the first 12 terms to approximate the series . What is the approximate value of the series?   For the first 12 terms, we take . We find: .   How many terms must we take to ensure that the th partial sum approximation for is accurate to 5 decimal places?   We have . For 5 decimal places of accuracy, we need .

Not only must the terms approach 0, they must approach 0 fast enough : while , the Harmonic Series diverges as the terms of do not approach 0 fast enough.   The comparison tests of the previous section determine convergence by comparing terms of a series to terms of another series whose convergence is known. This section introduces the Ratio and Root Tests, which determine convergence by analyzing the terms of a series to see if they approach 0 fast enough.     Ratio Test   Ratio Test   Let be a positive sequence and consider . series Ratio Comparison Test  Ratio Comparison Test for series  convergence Ratio Comparison Test  divergence Ratio Comparison Test      If , then converges.    If or , then diverges.    If , the Ratio Test is inconclusive.         Theorem allows us to apply the Ratio Test to series where is positive for all but a finite number of terms.    Video presentation of    The principle of the Ratio Test is this: if , then for large , each term of is significantly smaller than its previous term which is enough to ensure convergence.   Applying the Ratio Test   Use the Ratio Test to determine the convergence of the following series:               Video solution         : . Since the limit is , by the Ratio Test converges.

The fact that can be interpreted to mean that in the long run, the term is roughly times as large as , so is increasing by roughly a factor of in the long run. We could also use Theorem to determine that this series diverges. The exponential will dominate the polynomial in the long run, so .     : . Since the limit is 1, the Ratio Test is inconclusive. We can easily show this series converges using the . We can also use or , with each comparing to the series .       The Ratio Test is not effective when the terms of a series only contain algebraic functions (e.g., polynomials). It is most effective when the terms contain some factorials or exponentials. The previous example also reinforces our developing intuition: factorials dominate exponentials, which dominate algebraic functions, which dominate logarithmic functions. In Part 1 of the example, the factorial in the denominator dominated the exponential in the numerator, causing the series to converge. In Part 2, the exponential in the numerator dominated the algebraic function in the denominator, causing the series to diverge.  While we have used factorials in previous sections, we have not explored them closely and one is likely to not yet have a strong intuitive sense for how they behave. The following example gives more practice with factorials.   Applying the Ratio Test   Determine the convergence of .    Video solution     Before we begin, be sure to note the difference between and . When , the former is , whereas the latter is .  Applying the Ratio Test: .  Since the limit is , by the Ratio Test we conclude converges.  To find the limit in the second to last line, recall that we just need to examine the leading terms of the numerator and denominator, which are and respectively.      Root Test  The final test we introduce is the Root Test, which works particularly well on series where each term is raised to a power, and does not work well with terms containing factorials.   Root Test   Let be a positive sequence, and consider . series Root Comparison Test  Root Comparison Test for series  convergence Root Comparison Test  divergence Root Comparison Test      If , then converges.

Since the limit is less than 1, we conclude the series converges. Note: it is difficult to apply the Ratio Test to this series.     . Since the numerator approaches 1 (by L'Hospital's Rule) and the denominator grows to infinity, we have . Since the limit is less than 1, we conclude the series converges.     . Since this is greater than 1, we conclude the series diverges. (Note: The is easy to apply to this series.)  (Also note: The limit in the denominator is found in a similar fashion as was illustrated in Part . In general for any real number .)         Theorem allows us to apply the Root Test to series where is positive for all but a finite number of terms.   Each of the tests we have encountered so far has required that we analyze series from positive sequences. Section relaxes this restriction by considering alternating series , where the underlying sequence has terms that alternate between being positive and negative.

  "title": "Alternating Series and Absolute Convergence",
  "body": " Alternating Series and Absolute Convergence  All of the series convergence tests we have used require that the underlying sequence be a positive sequence. (We can relax this with Theorem and state that there must be an such that for all ; that is, is positive for all but a finite number of values of .)  In this section we explore series whose summation includes negative terms. We start with a very specific form of series, where the terms of the summation alternate between being positive and negative.   Alternating Series   Let be a positive sequence. An alternating series is a series of either the form series alternating  .    Recall the terms of Harmonic Series come from the Harmonic Sequence . An important alternating series is the Alternating Harmonic Series :   Geometric Series can also be alternating series when . For instance, if , the geometric series is    Theorem states that geometric series converge when and gives the sum: . When as above, we find .  A powerful convergence theorem exists for other alternating series that meet a few conditions.   Alternating Series Test   Let be a positive, decreasing sequence where . Then series Alternating Series Test  Alternating Series Test  convergence Alternating Series Test  divergence Alternating Series Test  converge.     Video presentation of and    The basic idea behind Theorem is illustrated in . A positive, decreasing sequence is shown along with the partial sums .  Because is decreasing, the amount by which bounces up\/down decreases. Moreover, the odd terms of form a decreasing, bounded sequence, while the even terms of form an increasing, bounded sequence. Since bounded, monotonic sequences converge (see Theorem ) and the terms of approach 0, one can show the odd and even terms of converge to the same common limit , the sum of the series.   Illustrating convergence with the Alternating Series Test          A visual representation of adding terms of an alternating series. The arrows represent the length and direction of each term of the sequence.          Applying the Alternating Series Test   Determine if the Alternating Series Test applies to each of the following series.                       Video solution        This is the Alternating Harmonic Series as seen previously. The underlying sequence is , which is positive, decreasing, and approaches 0 as . Therefore we can apply the Alternating Series Test and conclude this series converges. While the test does not state what the series converges to, we will see later that .    The underlying sequence is . This is positive and approaches 0 as (use L'Hospital's Rule). However, the sequence is not decreasing for all . It is straightforward to compute , , , and : the sequence is increasing for at least the first 3 terms. We do not immediately conclude that we cannot apply the Alternating Series Test. Rather, consider the long-term behavior of . Treating as a continuous function of defined on , we can take its derivative: . The derivative is negative for all (actually, for all ), meaning is decreasing on . We can apply the Alternating Series Test to the series when we start with and conclude that converges; adding the terms with and do not change the convergence ( , we apply Theorem ). The important lesson here is that as before, if a series fails to meet the criteria of the Alternating Series Test on only a finite number of terms, we can still apply the test.    The underlying sequence is . This sequence is positive and approaches as . However, it is not a decreasing sequence; the value of oscillates between and as . We cannot remove a finite number of terms to make decreasing, therefore we cannot apply the Alternating Series Test. Keep in mind that this does not mean we conclude the series diverges; in fact, it does converge. We are just unable to conclude this based on Theorem . We will be able to show that this series converges shortly.        Key Idea gives the sum of some important series. Two of these are .  These two series converge to their sums at different rates. To be accurate to two places after the decimal, we need 202 terms of the first series though only 13 of the second. To get 3 places of accuracy, we need 1069 terms of the first series though only 33 of the second. Why is it that the second series converges so much faster than the first?  While there are many factors involved when studying rates of convergence, the alternating structure of an alternating series gives us a powerful tool when approximating the sum of a convergent series.   The Alternating Series Approximation Theorem   Let be a sequence that satisfies the hypotheses of the Alternating Series Test, and let and be the th partial sums and sum, respectively, of either or . Then series alternating!Approximation Theorem       , and     is between and .        Video presentation of    Part 1 of Theorem states that the th partial sum of a convergent alternating series will be within of its total sum. You can see this visually in Figure . Look at the distance between and . Clearly this distance is less than the length of the arrow corresponding to .  Also consider the alternating series we looked at before the statement of the theorem, . Since , we know that is within of the total sum.  Moreover, Part 2 of the theorem states that since and , we know the sum lies between and . One use of this is the knowledge that is accurate to two places after the decimal.  Some alternating series converge slowly. In Example we determined the series converged. With , we find , meaning that is accurate to one, maybe two, places after the decimal. Since , we know the sum is .   Approximating the sum of convergent alternating series   Approximate the sum of the following series, accurate to within .                  Video solution        Using Theorem , we want to find where . That is, we want to find the the first time a term in the sequence is smaller than the desired level of error: . Let be the sum of this series. By Part 1 of the theorem, . (We found , so ). We can compute , which our theorem states is within of the total sum. We can use Part 2 of the theorem to obtain an even more accurate result. As we know the th term of the series is , we can easily compute . Part 2 of the theorem states that is between and , so .    We want to find where . We start by solving for . This cannot be solved algebraically, so we will use Newton's Method to approximate a solution. (Note: we can also use a Brute Force technique. That is, we can guess and check numerically until we find a solution.) Let ; we want to know where . We make a guess that must be large, so our initial guess will be . Recall how Newton's Method works: given an approximate solution , our next approximation is given by . We find . This gives . Using a computer, we find that Newton's Method seems to converge to a solution after 8 iterations. Taking the next integer higher, we have , where . Again using a computer, we find . Part 1 of the theorem states that this is within of the actual sum . Already knowing the th term, we can compute , meaning .     Notice how the first series converged quite quickly, where we needed only 10 terms to reach the desired accuracy, whereas the second series took over 9,000 terms.    One of the famous results of mathematics is that the Harmonic Series, diverges, yet the Alternating Harmonic Series, , converges. The notion that alternating the signs of the terms in a series can make a series converge leads us to the following definitions. Alternating Harmonic Series    Absolute and Conditional Convergence      A series  converges absolutely if converges. convergence absolute  convergence conditional  series absolute convergence  series conditional convergence     A series  converges conditionally if converges but diverges.        In Definition , is not necessarily an alternating series; it just may have some negative terms.   Thus we say the Alternating Harmonic Series converges conditionally.   Determining absolute and conditional convergence   Determine if the following series converge absolutely, conditionally, or diverge.               Video solution        We can show the series diverges using the Limit Comparison Test, comparing with . The series converges using the Alternating Series Test; we conclude it converges conditionally.    We can show the series converges using the Ratio Test. Therefore we conclude converges absolutely.    The series diverges using the th Term Test, so it does not converge absolutely. The series fails the conditions of the Alternating Series Test as does not approach as . We can state further that this series diverges; as , the series effectively adds and subtracts over and over. This causes the sequence of partial sums to oscillate and not converge. Therefore the series diverges.       Knowing that a series converges absolutely allows us to make two important statements, given in below. The first is that absolute convergence is stronger than regular convergence. That is, just because converges, we cannot conclude that will converge, but knowing a series converges absolutely tells us that will converge.  One reason this is important is that our convergence tests all require that the underlying sequence of terms be positive. By taking the absolute value of the terms of a series where not all terms are positive, we are often able to apply an appropriate test and determine absolute convergence. This, in turn, determines that the series we are given also converges.  The second statement relates to rearrangements  rearrangements of series  series rearrangements of series. When dealing with a finite set of numbers, the sum of the numbers does not depend on the order which they are added. (So .) One may be surprised to find out that when dealing with an infinite set of numbers, the same statement does not always hold true: some infinite lists of numbers may be rearranged in different orders to achieve different sums. The theorem states that the terms of an absolutely convergent series can be rearranged in any way without affecting the sum.   Video presentation of and     Absolute Convergence Theorem   Let be a series that converges absolutely. convergence absolute  Absolute Convergence Theorem  series Absolute Convergence Theorem  rearrangements of series  series rearrangements       converges.    Let be any rearrangement of the sequence . Then .       We will provide a proof for Part of . Suppose that converges. We start by noting that for any sequence , we have . We are now in a position to apply the to the series . Since converges by our supposition, so does (the scalar multiple of a convergent series also converges by theorem ). Therefore converges by the .  Now we turn our attention to . We can say . The last line is the difference between two convergent series, which is also convergent by Theorem . Therefore converges.    In Example , we determined the series in Part converges absolutely. Theorem tells us the series converges (which we could also determine using the Alternating Series Test).  The theorem states that rearranging the terms of an absolutely convergent series does not affect its sum. This implies that perhaps the sum of a conditionally convergent series can change based on the arrangement of terms. Indeed, it can. The Riemann Rearrangement Theorem (named after Bernhard Riemann) states that any conditionally convergent series can have its terms rearranged so that the sum is any desired value, including !  As an example, consider the Alternating Harmonic Series once more. We have stated that ,  (see Key Idea or Example ).  Consider the rearrangement where every positive term is followed by two negative terms:   (Convince yourself that these are exactly the same numbers as appear in the Alternating Harmonic Series, just in a different order.) Now group some terms and simplify: .  By rearranging the terms of the series, we have arrived at a different sum! (One could try to argue that the Alternating Harmonic Series does not actually converge to , because rearranging the terms of the series shouldn't change the sum. However, the Alternating Series Test proves this series converges to , for some number , and if the rearrangement does not change the sum, then , implying . But the Alternating Series Approximation Theorem quickly shows that . The only conclusion is that the rearrangement did change the sum.) This is an incredible result.  We end here our study of tests to determine convergence. The end of this text contains a table summarizing the tests that one may find useful.  While series are worthy of study in and of themselves, our ultimate goal within calculus is the study of Power Series, which we will consider in the next section. We will use power series to create functions where the output is the result of an infinite summation.    Terms and Concepts   Why is not an alternating series?   The signs of the terms do not alternate; in the given series, some terms are negative and the others positive, but they do not necessarily alternate.    A series converges when is , and = .   postive, decreasing, 0    Give an example of a series where converges but does not.   Many examples exist; one common example is .

  "title": "Power Series",
  "body": " Power Series  So far, our study of series has examined the question of Is the sum of these infinite terms finite?,  , Does the series converge? We now approach series from a different perspective: as a function. Given a value of , we evaluate by finding the sum of a particular series that depends on (assuming the series converges). We start this new approach to series with a definition.   Video introduction to     Power Series   Let be a sequence, let be a variable, and let be a real number. power series  series power      The power series in is the series     The power series in centered at is the series         Examples of power series   Write out the first five terms of the following power series:           Video solution        One of the conventions we adopt is that regardless of the value of . Therefore This is a geometric series in with .    This series is centered at . Note how this series starts with . We could rewrite this series starting at with the understanding that , and hence the first term is .     This series is centered at . Recall that .        We introduced power series as a type of function, where a value of is given and the sum of a series is returned. Of course, not every series converges. For instance, in part 1 of Example , we recognized the series as a geometric series in . Theorem states that this series converges only when .  This raises the question: For what values of will a given power series converge?, which leads us to a theorem and definition.   Convergence of Power Series   Let a power series be given. Then one of the following is true: convergence of power series  power series convergence  series power      The series converges only at .    There is an such that the series converges for all in and diverges for all and .    The series converges for all .        Video presentation of and    The value of is important when understanding a power series, hence it is given a name in the following definition. Also, note that part 2 of Theorem makes a statement about the interval , but the not the endpoints of that interval. A series may\/may not converge at these endpoints.   Radius and Interval of Convergence      The number given in Theorem is the radius of convergence of a given series. When a series converges for only , we say the radius of convergence is 0, , . When a series converges for all , we say the series has an infinite radius of convergence, , .    The interval of convergence is the set of all values of for which the series converges. convergence radius of  convergence interval of  radius of convergence  interval of convergence  series radius of convergence  series interval of convergence        To find the values of for which a given series converges, we will use the convergence tests we studied previously (especially the Ratio Test). However, the tests all required that the terms of a series be positive. The following theorem gives us a work-around to this problem.   The Radius of Convergence of a Series and Absolute Convergence   The series and have the same radius of convergence .     Theorem allows us to find the radius of convergence of a series by applying the Ratio Test (or any applicable test) to the absolute value of the terms of the series. We practice this in the following example.   Determining the radius and interval of convergence   Find the radius and interval of convergence for each of the following series:                            Video solution        We apply the Ratio Test to the series : . The Ratio Test shows us that regardless of the choice of , the series converges. Therefore the radius of convergence is , and the interval of convergence is .    We apply the Ratio Test to the series : . The Ratio Test states a series converges if the limit of . We found the limit above to be ; therefore, the power series converges when , or when is in . Thus the radius of convergence is . To determine the interval of convergence, we need to check the endpoints of . When , we have the opposite of the Harmonic Series: . The series diverges when . When , we have the series , which is the Alternating Harmonic Series, which converges. Therefore the interval of convergence is .    We apply the Ratio Test to the series : . According to the Ratio Test, the series converges when . The series is centered at 3, and must be within of 3 in order for the series to converge. Therefore the radius of convergence is , and we know that the series converges absolutely for all in . We check for convergence at the endpoints to find the interval of convergence. When , we have: , which diverges. A similar process shows that the series also diverges at . Therefore the interval of convergence is .    We apply the Ratio Test to : The Ratio Test shows that the series diverges for all except . Therefore the radius of convergence is .       We can use a power series to define a function: where the domain of is a subset of the interval of convergence of the power series. One can apply calculus techniques to such functions; in particular, we can find derivatives and antiderivatives.   Derivatives and Indefinite Integrals of Power Series Functions   Let be a function defined by a power series, with radius of convergence .      is continuous and differentiable on .     , with radius of convergence .     , with radius of convergence .    series power!derivatives and integrals  integration of power series  derivative power series  power series derivatives and integrals      Video presentation of    A few notes about Theorem :     The theorem states that differentiation and integration do not change the radius of convergence. It does not state anything about the interval of convergence. They are not always the same.    Notice how the summation for starts with . This is because the constant term of becomes through differentiation.    Differentiation and integration are simply calculated term-by-term using the Power Rules.      Derivatives and indefinite integrals of power series   Let . Find and , along with their respective intervals of convergence.    Video solution     We find the derivative and indefinite integral of , following Theorem .      . In Example , we recognized that is a geometric series in . We know that such a geometric series converges when ; that is, the interval of convergence is . To determine the interval of convergence of , we consider the endpoints of :  Therefore, the interval of convergence of is .     To find the interval of convergence of , we again consider the endpoints of : The value of is irrelevant; notice that the rest of the series is an Alternating Series that whose terms converge to 0. By the Alternating Series Test, this series converges. (In fact, we can recognize that the terms of the series after are the opposite of the Alternating Harmonic Series. We can thus say that .) Notice that this summation is the Harmonic Series, which diverges. Since converges for and diverges for , the interval of convergence of is .       The previous example showed how to take the derivative and indefinite integral of a power series without motivation for why we care about such operations. We may care for the sheer mathematical enjoyment that we can , which is motivation enough for many. However, we would be remiss to not recognize that we can learn a great deal from taking derivatives and indefinite integrals.  Recall that in Example is a geometric series. According to Theorem , this series converges to when . Thus we can say .  Integrating the power series, (as done in Example ,) we find , while integrating the function gives .  Equating Equations and , we have .  Letting , we have . This implies that we can drop the constants and conclude .  We established in Example that the series on the left converges at ; substituting on both sides of the above equality gives .  On the left we have the opposite of the Alternating Harmonic Series; on the right, we have . We conclude that .   Important: We stated in Key Idea (in Section ) that the Alternating Harmonic Series converges to , and referred to this fact again in Example of Section . However, we never gave an argument for why this was the case. The work above finally shows how we conclude that the Alternating Harmonic Series converges to . Alternating Harmonic Series   We use this type of analysis in the next example.   Analyzing power series functions   Let . Find and , and use these to analyze the behavior of .    Video solution     We start by making two notes: first, in Example , we found the interval of convergence of this power series is . Second, we will find it useful later to have a few terms of the series written out:   We now find the derivative: .  We found the derivative of is . The only functions for which this is true are of the form for some constant . As (see Equation ), must be 1. Therefore we conclude that for all .  We can also find :   We write out a few terms of this last series:   The integral of differs from only by a constant, again indicating that .     Example and the work following Example established relationships between a power series function and regular functions that we have dealt with in the past. In general, given a power series function, it is difficult (if not impossible) to express the function in terms of elementary functions. We chose examples where things worked out nicely.  In this section's last example, we show how to solve a simple differential equation with a power series.   Solving a differential equation with a power series   Give the first 4 terms of the power series solution to , where .    The differential equation describes a function where the derivative of is twice and . This is a rather simple differential equation; with a bit of thought one should realize that if , then , and hence . By letting we satisfy the initial condition of .  Let's ignore the fact that we already know the solution and find a power series function that satisfies the equation. The solution we seek will have the form for unknown coefficients . We can find using Theorem : .  Since , we have   The coefficients of like powers of must be equal, so we find that   The initial condition indicates that ; with this, we can find the values of the other coefficients: .  Thus the first 5 terms of the power series solution to the differential equation is   In Section , as we study Taylor Series, we will learn how to recognize this series as describing .    Our last example illustrates that it can be difficult to recognize an elementary function by its power series expansion. It is far easier to start with a known function, expressed in terms of elementary functions, and represent it as a power series function. One may wonder why we would bother doing so, as the latter function probably seems more complicated. In the next two sections, we show both how to do this and why such a process can be beneficial.    Terms and Concepts   We adopt the convention that , regardless of the value of .   We define (even when ).    What is the difference between the radius of convergence and the interval of convergence?   The radius of convergence is a value  such that a power series, centered at , converges for all values of in . The interval of convergence is an interval on which the power series converges; it may differ from only at the endpoints.    If the radius of convergence of is 5, what is the radius of convergence of ?   It is still 5: the derivative of a power series has the same radius of convergence as the original power series.    If the radius of convergence of is 5, what is the radius of convergence of ?   It is still 5, since radius of convergence is measured using absolute convergence. However, it's possible that the endpoints of the interval of convergence might change.     Problems    In the following exercises, write out the sum of the first 5 terms of the given power series.

We can find a polynomial, , that does match the concavity near without much difficulty, though. The table in Table gives the following information: .  Therefore, we want our polynomial to have these same properties. That is, we need .  This is simply an initial-value problem. We can solve this using the techniques first described in Section . To keep as simple as possible, we'll assume that not only , but that . That is, the second derivative of is constant, meaning is a quadratic function.  If , then for some constant . Since we have determined that , we find that and so . Finally, we can compute . Using our initial values, we know so . We conclude that . This function is plotted with in Figure .  We can repeat this approximation process by creating polynomials of higher degree that match more of the derivatives of at . In general, a polynomial of degree can be created to match the first derivatives of . Figure shows , whose first four derivatives at 0 match those of . (Using the table in Table , start with and solve the related initial-value problem.)   Plotting , and          Determining the coefficients of a Taylor polynomial    As we use more and more derivatives, our polynomial approximation to gets better and better. In this example, the interval on which the approximation is good gets bigger and bigger. Figure shows ; we can visually affirm that this polynomial approximates very well on . (The polynomial is not particularly nice . It is .   Plotting and         The polynomials we have created are examples of Taylor polynomials , named after the British mathematician Brook Taylor who made important discoveries about such functions. While we created the above Taylor polynomials by solving initial-value problems, it can be shown that Taylor polynomials follow a general pattern that make their formation much more direct. This is described in the following definition.   Taylor Polynomial, Maclaurin Polynomial   Let be a function whose first derivatives exist at .

While this is not as straightforward as it was in the previous example, a pattern does emerge (for ), as shown in Table . Notice in the table below that each time we take a derivative (starting at the second derivative), we apply the power rule and bring down the exponent to multiply by the previous coefficent. So the in the derivative is actually .   Derivatives of evaluated at                                             Notice that the coefficients alternate in sign starting at . Using Definition , we have . Note how the coefficients of the terms turn out to be nice.     We can compute using our work above: . Since approximates well near , we approximate : . This is a good approximation as a calculator shows that . Figure below plots with . We can see that .     We approximate with : . This approximation is not terribly impressive: a hand held calculator shows that . The graph in Figure shows that provides less accurate approximations of as gets close to 0 or 2. Surprisingly enough, even the th degree Taylor polynomial fails to approximate for very well, as shown in Figure . We'll soon discuss why this is.        A plot of and its 6th degree Taylor polynomial at          A plot of and its 20 degree Taylor polynomial at             As always in calculus, angles are measured in radians, so the in is an angle of radians.   Taylor polynomials are used to approximate functions in mainly two situations:   When is known, but perhaps hard to compute directly. For instance, we can define the cosine of an angle as either the ratio of sides of a right triangle ( adjacent over hypotenuse ) or using the definition in terms of the unit circle. However, neither of these provides a convenient way of computing . A Taylor polynomial of sufficiently high degree can provide a reasonable method of computing such values using only operations usually hard-wired into a computer ( , , and ).    When is not known, but information about its derivatives is known. This occurs more often than one might think, especially in the study of differential equations.     In both situations, a critical piece of information to have is How good is my approximation? If we use a Taylor polynomial to compute , how do we know how accurate the approximation is?   Even though Taylor polynomials could be used in calculators and computers to calculate values of trigonometric functions, in practice they generally aren't. Other more efficient and accurate methods have been developed, such as the CORDIC algorithm. However, understanding how Taylor polynomials could be used is important to developing an understanding of various approximating techniques.   We had the same problem when studying Numerical Integration. Theorem provided bounds on the error when using, say, Simpson's Rule to approximate a definite integral. These bounds allowed us to determine that, for instance, using subintervals provided an approximation within of the exact value. The following theorem gives similar bounds for Taylor (and hence Maclaurin) polynomials.   Taylor's Theorem      Let be a function whose derivative exists on an interval and let be in . Then, for each in , there exists between and such that  , where . Taylor Polynomial Taylor's Theorem  Taylor's Theorem      , where is in .         Video presentation of    The first part of Taylor's Theorem states that , where is the th order Taylor polynomial and is the remainder, or error, in the Taylor approximation. The second part gives bounds on how big that error can be. If the th derivative is large on , the error may be large; if is far from , the error may also be large. However, the term in the denominator tends to ensure that the error gets smaller as increases.  The following example computes error estimates for the approximations of and made in Example .   Finding error bounds of a Taylor polynomial   Use Theorem to find error bounds when approximating and with , the Taylor polynomial of degree 6 of at , as calculated in Example .    Video solution        We start with the approximation of with . The theorem references an open interval that contains both and . The smaller the interval we use the better; it will give us a more accurate (and smaller!) approximation of the error. We let , as this interval contains both and . The theorem references . In our situation, this is asking How big can the th derivative of be on the interval ? The seventh derivative is . The largest absolute value it attains on is about 1506. (There are no critical numbers of in the interval so we evaluate the endpoints: and .) In particular, we are evaluating at , so we let . Thus we can bound the error as: . We computed ; using a calculator, we find , so the actual error is about , which is less than our bound of . This affirms Taylor's Theorem; the theorem states that our approximation would be within about 2 thousandths of the actual value, whereas the approximation was actually closer. only gives an upper bound on the error.    We again find an interval that contains both and ; we choose . The maximum value of the seventh derivative of on this interval is again about 1506 (as the largest values come near ). Thus . This bound is not as nearly as good as before. Using the degree 6 Taylor polynomial at will bring us within 0.3 of the correct answer. As , our error estimate guarantees that the actual value of is somewhere between and . These bounds are not particularly useful. In reality, our approximation was only off by about 0.07. However, we are approximating ostensibly because we do not know the real answer. In order to be assured that we have a good approximation, we would have to resort to using a polynomial of higher degree.       We practice again. This time, we use Taylor's theorem to find that guarantees our approximation is within a certain amount.   Finding sufficiently accurate Taylor polynomials   Find such that the th Taylor polynomial of at approximates to within of the actual answer. What is ?    Video solution     Following Taylor's theorem, we need bounds on the size of the derivatives of . In the case of this trigonometric function, this is easy. All derivatives of cosine are or . In all cases, these functions are never greater than 1 in absolute value. We want the error to be less than . To find the appropriate , consider the following inequalities: .  We find an that satisfies this last inequality with trial-and-error. When , we have ; when , we have . Thus we want to approximate with .  We now set out to compute . We again need a table of the derivatives of evaluated at . A table of these values is given in Table .   A table of the derivatives of evaluated at                                                       Notice how the derivatives, evaluated at , follow a certain pattern. All the odd powers of in the Taylor polynomial will disappear as their coefficient is . While our error bounds state that we need , our work shows that this will be the same as .  Since we are forming our polynomial at , we are creating a Maclaurin polynomial, and: .  We finally approximate : .  Our error bound guarantee that this approximation is within of the correct answer. Technology shows us that our approximation is actually within about of the correct answer.   Figure shows a graph of and . Note how well the two functions agree on about .

Find bounds on the error when approximating with .          We begin by evaluating the derivatives of at . This is done in Table .   A table of the derivatives of evaluated at                              These values allow us to form the Taylor polynomial : .    As near , we approximate with .    To find a bound on the error, we need an open interval that contains and . We set . The largest value the fifth derivative of takes on this interval is near , at about . (We often graph the derivative to find its extrema. In this case is is always decreasing, so the maximum occurs at .) Thus . This shows our approximation is accurate to at least the first 2 places after the decimal. (It turns out that our approximation is actually accurate to 4 places after the decimal.) A graph of and is given in Figure . Note how the two functions are nearly indistinguishable on .       A graph of and its degree 4 Taylor polynomial at           Our final example gives a brief introduction to using Taylor polynomials to solve differential equations.   Approximating an unknown function   A function is unknown save for the following two facts.    , and          (This second fact says that amazingly, the derivative of the function is actually the function squared!)

This topic is often broached in introductory Differential Equations courses and usually covered in depth in Numerical Analysis courses. Such an analysis is very important; one needs to know how good their approximation is. We explored this example simply to demonstrate the usefulness of Taylor polynomials.  Most of this chapter has been devoted to the study of infinite series. This section has taken a step back from this study, focusing instead on finite summation of terms. In the next section, we explore Taylor Series , where we represent a function with an infinite series.    Terms and Concepts    What is the difference between a Taylor polynomial and a Maclaurin polynomial?   The Maclaurin polynomial is a special case of Taylor polynomials. Taylor polynomials are centered at a specific -value; when that -value is 0, it is a Maclauring polynomial.         True or False? In general, approximates better and better as gets larger.   ?    True    False          True: this is essentially the content of Taylor s Theorem. For most well-behaved functions, the size of the remainder, which quantifies the error in our approximation, gets smaller.         For some function the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 4 is What is         A higher-degree Maclaurin polynomial begins with the same terms as any lower-degree Maclaurin polynomial of the same function. Therefore,          For some function the Maclaurin polynomial of degree 4 is What is         Since the coefficient of in a Maclaurin polynomial is equal to we have so         Problems    In the following exercises, find the Maclaurin polynomial of degree for the given function.

  "body": " Taylor Series  In Section , we showed how certain functions can be represented by a power series function. In Section , we showed how we can approximate functions with polynomials, given that enough derivative information is available. In this section we combine these concepts: if a function is infinitely differentiable, we show how to represent it with a power series function.   Video introduction to     Taylor and Maclaurin Series   Let have derivatives of all orders at . Taylor Series definition  Maclaurin Series definition  Maclaurin Series|see{Taylor Series}  series Taylor  series Maclaurin      The Taylor Series of , centered at is .    Setting gives the Maclaurin Series of : .       If is the th degree Taylor polynomial for centered at , we saw how is approximately equal to near . We also saw how increasing the degree of the polynomial generally reduced the error.  We are now considering series , where we sum an infinite set of terms. Our ultimate hope is to see the error vanish and claim a function is equal to its Taylor series.  When creating the Taylor polynomial of degree for a function at , we needed to evaluate , and the first derivatives of , at . When creating the Taylor series of , it helps to find a pattern that describes the th derivative of at . We demonstrate this in the next two examples.   The Maclaurin series of   Find the Maclaurin series of .    Video solution     In Example we found the th degree Maclaurin polynomial of . In doing so, we created the table shown in Table .   A table of the derivatives of evaluated at                                                       Notice how when is odd, when is divisible by , and when is even but not divisible by 4. Thus the Maclaurin series of is   We can go further and write this as a summation. The coefficients alternate between positive and negative. Since we only need the terms where the power of is even, we write the power series in terms of : .  This Maclaurin series is a special type of power series. As such, we should determine its interval of convergence. Applying the Ratio Test, we have .  For any fixed , this limit is 0. Therefore this power series has an infinite radius of convergence, converging for all . It is important to note what we have, and have not, determined: we have determined the Maclaurin series for along with its interval of convergence. We have not shown that is equal to this power series.     Example found the Taylor Series representation of . We can easily find the Taylor Series representation of by recognizing that and apply Theorem .   The Taylor series of at   Find the Taylor series of centered at .    Video solution      Figure shows the th derivative of evaluated at for , along with an expression for the th term:   Remember that this is what distinguishes Taylor series from Taylor polynomials; we are very interested in finding a pattern for the th term, not just finding a finite set of coefficients for a polynomial.   Derivatives of evaluated at                                                  Since , we skip the first term and start the summation with , giving the Taylor series for , centered at , as .  We now determine the interval of convergence, using the Ratio Test. .  By the Ratio Test, we have convergence when : the radius of convergence is 1, and we have convergence on . We now check the endpoints.  At , the series is , which diverges (it is the Harmonic Series times .)  At , the series is , the Alternating Harmonic Series, which converges.   It can be shown that is equal to this Taylor series on . From the work in Example , this justifies our previous declaration that the Alternating Harmonic Series converges to .   We have found the Taylor series of centered at , and have determined the series converges on . We cannot (yet) say that is equal to this Taylor series on .    It is important to note that Definition defines a Taylor series given a function , but makes no claim about their equality. We will find that most of the time they are equal, but we need to consider the conditions that allow us to conclude this.   Theorem states that the error between a function and its th-degree Taylor polynomial is , where .  If goes to 0 for each in an interval as approaches infinity, we conclude that the function is equal to its Taylor series expansion.   Function and Taylor Series Equality   Let have derivatives of all orders at , let be as stated in Theorem , and let be an interval on which the Taylor series of converges. If for all in , then Taylor Series equality with generating function       Video presentation of    We demonstrate the use of this theorem in an example.   Establishing equality of a function and its Taylor series   Show that is equal to its Maclaurin series, as found in Example , for all .    Given a value , the magnitude of the error term is bounded by .  Since all derivatives of are or , whose magnitudes are bounded by , we can state which implies .  For any , . Applying the Squeeze Theorem to Equation , we conclude that for all , and hence .    It is natural to assume that a function is equal to its Taylor series on the series' interval of convergence, but this is not always the case. In order to properly establish equality, one must use Theorem . This is a bit disappointing, as we developed beautiful techniques for determining the interval of convergence of a power series, and proving that can be difficult. For instance, it is not a simple task to show that equals its Taylor series on as found in Example ; in the Exercises, the reader is only asked to show equality on , which is simpler.  There is good news. A function that is equal to its Taylor series, centered at any point the domain of , is said to be an analytic function , analytic function and most, if not all, functions that we encounter within this course are analytic functions. Generally speaking, any function that one creates with elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc.) that is not piecewise defined is probably analytic. For most functions, we assume the function is equal to its Taylor series on the series' interval of convergence and only use Theorem when we suspect something may not work as expected.  We develop the Taylor series for one more important function, then give a table of the Taylor series for a number of common functions. Binomial Series  series Binomial    The Binomial Series   Find the Maclaurin series of , .    Video solution     When is a positive integer, the Maclaurin series is finite. For instance, when , we have .  The coefficients of when is a positive integer are known as the binomial coefficients , giving the series we are developing its name.  When , we have . Knowing a series representation of this function would give a useful way of approximating , for instance.  To develop the Maclaurin series for for any value of , we consider the derivatives of evaluated at :   For a general , , giving .  Thus the Maclaurin series for is   It is important to determine the interval of convergence of this series. With , we apply the Ratio Test: .  The series converges absolutely when the limit of the Ratio Test is less than 1; therefore, we have absolute convergence when .  While outside the scope of this text, the interval of convergence depends on the value of . When , the interval of convergence is . When , the interval of convergence is . If , the interval of convergence is .    We learned that Taylor polynomials offer a way of approximating a difficult to compute function with a polynomial. Taylor series offer a way of exactly representing a function with a series. One probably can see the use of a good approximation; is there any use of representing a function exactly as a series?  While we should not overlook the mathematical beauty of Taylor series (which is reason enough to study them), there are practical uses as well. They provide a valuable tool for solving a variety of problems, including problems relating to integration and differential equations.  In Key Idea (on the following page) we give a table of the Taylor series of a number of common functions. We then give a theorem about the algebra of power series, that is, how we can combine power series to create power series of new functions. This allows us to find the Taylor series of functions like by knowing the Taylor series of and .  Before we investigate combining functions, consider the Taylor series for the arctangent function (see Key Idea ). Knowing that , we can use this series to approximate the value of :   Unfortunately, this particular expansion of converges very slowly. The first 100 terms approximate as , which is not particularly good.   Important Taylor Series Expansions    Function and Series  First Few Terms  Interval of    Convergence                                       Note that for , the interval of convergence may contain one or both endpoints, depending on the value of , and we are using the generalized binomial coefficients . Taylor Series common series     Algebra of Power Series   Let and converge absolutely for , and let be a polynomial function. power series algebra of       for .     for .     for .        Note that we require to be a polynomial function in . If we plug a function that is not polynomial into a power series, the result will no longer be a power series. If one is very careful about the centre and radius of convergence, it is technically possible to substitute the Taylor series for a general function into the Taylor series for , and the result will be the Taylor series for .  In practice, is typically a monomial function of the form . For anything more complicated, rearranging the power series into a standard form becomes a nightmare.    Deriving the Taylor series for in Key Idea     Combining Taylor series   Write out the first 3 terms of the Taylor Series for using Key Idea and Theorem .    Video solution      Key Idea informs us that .  Applying Theorem , we find that . Distribute the right hand expression across the left: If we distribute again and collect like terms, we find .  While this process is a bit tedious, it is much faster than evaluating all the necessary derivatives of and computing the Taylor series directly.  Because the series for and both converge on , so does the series expansion for .     Creating new Taylor series   Use Theorem to create series for and .    Video solution     Given that , we simply substitute for in the series, giving .  Since the Taylor series for has an infinite radius of convergence, so does the Taylor series for .  For , we begin with the geometric series expansion . Note that we can write . Substituting into the geometric series expansion, we get . Finally, we can multiply both sides of the above equation by to obtain .     A (somewhat foolish) combination of Taylor series   Discuss possible methods for obtaining a Taylor series expansion for .    Since is a composition, our first instict might be to apply to the problem. However, is not a polynomial function, and neither nor have Maclaurin series expansions.  You might already see a simple way to proceed, but let us first consider the following: can be expanded as a binomial series centered at . We also know the Taylor series for at , and note that , so when is near 1, so is .  What happens if we take the Taylor series and substitute in , where denotes the binomial coefficient?  Short answer: a mess. We have to replace each occurence of in the power series for with , and then expand, and collect terms. If we do this, keeping only terms up to , we find: .  But of course, there was a better way all along: using properties of the logarithm, and indeed, the result above is the same as the one we would have obtained by simply multiplying the Taylor series for by . Power series manipulation is a powerful technique, but one should not apply it blindly.     Using Taylor series to approximate a composition   Use Taylor series to determine a degree 5 Taylor polynomial approximation to .    Here we want to apply , but is not a polynomial. However, we are interested in approximation, so we replace by the Maclaurin polynomial . The Maclaurin series for is given by . Next, we substitute into the series for . The algebra gets very messy, but we can simplify things: since we want the degree 5 approximation, there is no need to write down terms involving or higher powers. .  While the algebra is a bit of a mess, it is often less work than computing the Taylor polynomial directly, as the derivatives of a composite function quickly get complicated. The function and its approximation are plotted in below. Note that our polynomial approximation is very good on .   A graph of and its degree 5 Maclaurin polynomial         In the previous example, the reader might be left wondering why we would bother with all that algebra, when the computer could have given us the result in seconds. One reason is simply that it lets us see how these different pieces fit together. Computing a Taylor polynomial by combining existing results will give the same polynomial as computing derivatives. Also we see that we can compute an approximation by replacing both parts of a composition with approximations. In the last couple of examples in this chapter, we see another reason: often we have to define functions in terms of power series derived through integration, or the solution of a differential equation, where there is no known function we can simply plug into the computer.   Using Taylor series to evaluate definite integrals   Use the Taylor series of to evaluate .    Video solution     We learned, when studying Numerical Integration, that does not have an antiderivative expressible in terms of elementary functions. This means any definite integral of this function must have its value approximated, and not computed exactly.  We can quickly write out the Taylor series for using the Taylor series of : .  We use Theorem to integrate:   This is the antiderivative of ; while we can write it out as a series, we cannot write it out in terms of elementary functions. We can evaluate the definite integral using this antiderivative; substituting 1 and 0 for and subtracting gives .  Summing the 5 terms shown above give the approximation of . Since this is an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series Approximation Theorem, ( Theorem ), to determine how accurate this approximation is. The next term of the series is . Thus we know our approximation is within of the actual value of the integral. This is arguably much less work than using Simpson's Rule to approximate the value of the integral.     Using Taylor series to solve differential equations   Solve the differential equation in terms of a power series, and use the theory of Taylor series to recognize the solution in terms of an elementary function.    Video solution     We found the first 5 terms of the power series solution to this differential equation in Example in Section . These are: .  We include the unsimplified expressions for the coefficients found in Example as we are looking for a pattern. It can be shown that . Thus the solution, written as a power series, is .  Using Key Idea and Theorem , we recognize : .    Finding a pattern in the coefficients that match the series expansion of a known function, such as those shown in Key Idea , can be difficult. What if the coefficients in the previous example were given in their reduced form; how could we still recover the function ?  Suppose that all we know is that .   Definition states that each term of the Taylor expansion of a function includes an . This allows us to say that for some values , and . Solving for these values, we see that , and . That is, we are recovering the pattern we had previously seen, allowing us to write   From here it is easier to recognize that the series is describing an exponential function.  There are simpler, more direct ways of solving the differential equation , as discussed in Chapter . We applied power series techniques to this equation to demonstrate its utility, and went on to show how sometimes we are able to recover the solution in terms of elementary functions using the theory of Taylor series. Most differential equations faced in real scientific and engineering situations are much more complicated than this one, but power series can offer a valuable tool in finding, or at least approximating, the solution.  This chapter introduced sequences, which are ordered lists of numbers, followed by series, wherein we add up the terms of a sequence. We quickly saw that such sums do not always add up to infinity, but rather converge. We studied tests for convergence, then ended the chapter with a formal way of defining functions based on series. Such series-defined functions are a valuable tool in solving a number of different problems throughout science and engineering.  Coming in the next chapters are new ways of defining curves in the plane apart from using functions of the form . Curves created by these new methods can be beautiful, useful, and important.    Terms and Concepts   What is the difference between a Taylor polynomial and a Taylor series?   A Taylor polynomial is a polynomial , containing a finite number of terms.

  "title": "Conic Sections",
  "body": " Conic Sections   The ancient Greeks recognized that interesting shapes can be formed by intersecting a plane with a double napped cone ( , two identical cones placed tip-to-tip as shown in the following figures). As these shapes are formed as sections of conics, they have earned the official name conic sections.    Video introduction to    The three most interesting conic sections are given in the top row of Figure . They are the parabola, the ellipse (which includes circles) and the hyperbola. In each of these cases, the plane does not intersect the tips of the cones (usually taken to be the origin).   Conic Sections     Parabola     Ellipse     Circle     Hyperbola       Point     Line     Crossed Lines       When the plane does contain the origin, three degenerate cones can be formed as shown the bottom row of Figure : a point, a line, and crossed lines. We focus here on the nondegenerate cases. conic sections  conic sections degenerate   While the above geometric constructs define the conics in an intuitive, visual way, these constructs are not very helpful when trying to analyze the shapes algebraically or consider them as the graph of a function. It can be shown that all conics can be defined by the general second-degree equation .  While this algebraic definition has its uses, most find another geometric perspective of the conics more beneficial.  Each nondegenerate conic can be defined as the locus , or set, of points that satisfy a certain distance property. These distance properties can be used to generate an algebraic formula, allowing us to study each conic as the graph of a function.    Parabolas   Video introduction to the parabola     Parabola   A parabola is the locus of all points equidistant from a point (called a focus ) and a line (called the directrix ) that does not contain the focus. conic sections parabola  parabola definition  directrix  focus      Illustrating the definition of the parabola and establishing an algebraic formula          Figure illustrates this definition. The point halfway between the focus and the directrix is the vertex . The line through the focus, perpendicular to the directrix, is the axis of symmetry , as the portion of the parabola on one side of this line is the mirror-image of the portion on the opposite side.  The definition leads us to an algebraic formula for the parabola. Let be a point on a parabola whose focus is at and whose directrix is at . (We'll assume for now that the focus lies on the -axis; by placing the focus units above the -axis and the directrix units below this axis, the vertex will be at .)  We use the Distance Formula to find the distance between and : .  The distance from to the directrix is more straightforward: .  These two distances are equal. Setting , we can solve for in terms of : .  The geometric definition of the parabola has led us to the familiar quadratic function whose graph is a parabola with vertex at the origin. When we allow the vertex to not be at , we get the following standard form of the parabola.   General Equation of a Parabola      Vertical Axis of Symmetry: The equation of the parabola with vertex at and directrix in standard form is . The focus is at .     Horizontal Axis of Symmetry: The equation of the parabola with vertex at and directrix in standard form is . The focus is at .     Note: is not necessarily a positive number. parabola general equation     Finding the equation of a parabola   Give the equation of the parabola with focus at and directrix at .    Video solution     The vertex is located halfway between the focus and directrix, so . This gives . Using Key Idea we have the equation of the parabola as .   The parabola described in Example         The parabola is sketched in Figure .     Finding the focus and directrix of a parabola   Find the focus and directrix of the parabola . The point lies on the graph of this parabola; verify that it is equidistant from the focus and directrix.    Video solution     We need to put the equation of the parabola in its general form. This requires us to complete the square: .  Hence the vertex is located at . We have , so . We conclude that the focus is located at and the directrix is . The parabola is graphed in Figure , along with its focus and directrix.   The parabola described in Example . The distances from a point on the parabola to the focus and directrix are given.         The point lies on the graph and is units from the directrix. The distance from to the focus is: .  Indeed, the point on the parabola is equidistant from the focus and directrix.     Reflective Property  One of the fascinating things about the nondegenerate conic sections is their reflective properties. Parabolas have the following reflective property:   Any ray emanating from the focus that intersects the parabola reflects off along a line perpendicular to the directrix.   This is illustrated in Figure . The following theorem states this more rigorously.   Illustrating the parabola's reflective property          Reflective Property of the Parabola   Let be a point on a parabola. The tangent line to the parabola at makes equal angles with the following two lines:     The line containing and the focus , and    The line perpendicular to the directrix through . parabola reflective property        Because of this reflective property, paraboloids (the 3D analogue of parabolas) make for useful flashlight reflectors as the light from the bulb, ideally located at the focus, is reflected along parallel rays. Satellite dishes also have paraboloid shapes. Signals coming from satellites effectively approach the dish along parallel rays. The dish then focuses these rays at the focus, where the sensor is located.     Ellipses   Video introduction to the ellipse     Ellipse   An ellipse is the locus of all points whose sum of distances from two fixed points, each a focus of the ellipse, is constant. conic sections ellipse  ellipse definition  focus     An easy way to visualize this construction of an ellipse is to pin both ends of a string to a board. The pins become the foci. Holding a pencil tight against the string places the pencil on the ellipse; the sum of distances from the pencil to the pins is constant: the length of the string. See Figure .   Illustrating the construction of an ellipse with pins, pencil and string         We can again find an algebraic equation for an ellipse using this geometric definition. Let the foci be located along the -axis, units from the origin. Let these foci be labeled as and . Let be a point on the ellipse. The sum of distances from to ( ) and from to ( ) is a constant . That is, . Using the Distance Formula, we have .  Using a fair amount of algebra can produce the following equation of an ellipse (note that the equation is an implicitly defined function; it has to be, as an ellipse fails the Vertical Line Test): .  This is not particularly illuminating, but by making the substitution and , we can rewrite the above equation as .  This choice of and is not without reason; as shown in Figure , the values of and have geometric meaning in the graph of the ellipse.   Labeling the significant features of an ellipse         In general, the two foci of an ellipse lie on the major axis of the ellipse, and the midpoint of the segment joining the two foci is the center . The major axis intersects the ellipse at two points, each of which is a vertex . The line segment through the center and perpendicular to the major axis is the minor axis . The constant sum of distances that defines the ellipse is the length of the major axis, , .  Allowing for the shifting of the ellipse gives the following standard equations.   Standard Equation of the Ellipse  The equation of an ellipse centered at with major axis of length and minor axis of length in standard form is:      Horizontal major axis:  .     Vertical major axis:  .     The foci lie along the major axis, units from the center, where . ellipse standard equation     Finding the equation of an ellipse   Find the general equation of the ellipse graphed in Figure .   The ellipse used in Example           Video solution     The center is located at . The distance from the center to a vertex is 5 units, hence . The minor axis seems to have length 4, so . Thus the equation of the ellipse is .     Graphing an ellipse   Graph the ellipse defined by .    Video solution     It is simple to graph an ellipse once it is in standard form. In order to put the given equation in standard form, we must complete the square with both the and terms. We first rewrite the equation by regrouping: .  Now we complete the squares. .  We see the center of the ellipse is at . We have and ; the major axis is horizontal, so the vertices are located at and . We find . The foci are located along the major axis, approximately units from the center, at . This is all graphed in Figure    Graphing the ellipse in Example            Eccentricity  When , we have a circle. The general equation becomes , the familiar equation of the circle centered at with radius . Since , . The circle has two foci, but they lie on the same point, the center of the circle.  Consider Figure , where several ellipses are graphed with . In Figure , we have and the ellipse is a circle. As grows, the resulting ellipses look less and less circular. A measure of this noncircularness is eccentricity .   Understanding the eccentricity of an ellipse                                              Eccentricity of an Ellipse   The eccentricity of an ellipse is . ellipse eccentricity  eccentricity     The eccentricity of a circle is 0; that is, a circle has no noncircularness. As approaches , approaches 1, giving rise to a very noncircular ellipse, as seen in Figure .  It was long assumed that planets had circular orbits. This is known to be incorrect; the orbits are elliptical. Earth has an eccentricity of  it has a nearly circular orbit. Mercury's orbit is the most eccentric, with . (Pluto's eccentricity is greater, at , the greatest of all the currently known dwarf planets.) The planet with the most circular orbit is Venus, with . The Earth's moon has an eccentricity of , also very circular.    Reflective Property  The ellipse also possesses an interesting reflective property. Any ray emanating from one focus of an ellipse reflects off the ellipse along a line through the other focus, as illustrated in Figure . This property is given formally in the following theorem.   Illustrating the reflective property of an ellipse          Reflective Property of an Ellipse   Let be a point on a ellipse with foci and . The tangent line to the ellipse at makes equal angles with the following two lines: ellipse reflective property      The line through and , and    The line through and .       This reflective property is useful in optics and is the basis of the phenomena experienced in whispering halls.     Hyperbolas   Video introduction to hyperbolas    The definition of a hyperbola is very similar to the definition of an ellipse; we essentially just change the word sum to difference.    Hyperbola   A hyperbola is the locus of all points where the absolute value of difference of distances from two fixed points, each a focus of the hyperbola, is constant. conic sections hyperbola  hyperbola definition  focus     We do not have a convenient way of visualizing the construction of a hyperbola as we did for the ellipse. The geometric definition does allow us to find an algebraic expression that describes it. It will be useful to define some terms first.  The two foci lie on the transverse axis of the hyperbola; the midpoint of the line segment joining the foci is the center of the hyperbola. The transverse axis intersects the hyperbola at two points, each a vertex of the hyperbola. The line through the center and perpendicular to the transverse axis is the conjugate axis. This is illustrated in Figure . It is easy to show that the constant difference of distances used in the definition of the hyperbola is the distance between the vertices, , .   Labeling the significant features of a hyperbola          Standard Equation of a Hyperbola  The equation of a hyperbola centered at in standard form is: hyperbola standard equation       Horizontal Transverse Axis:  .     Vertical Transverse Axis:  .     The vertices are located units from the center and the foci are located units from the center, where .    Graphing Hyperbolas  Consider the hyperbola . Solving for , we find . As grows large, the part of the equation for becomes less significant and . That is, as gets large, the graph of the hyperbola looks very much like the lines . These lines are asymptotes of the hyperbola, as shown in Figure .   Graphing the hyperbola along with its asymptotes,         This is a valuable tool in sketching. Given the equation of a hyperbola in general form, draw a rectangle centered at with sides of length parallel to the transverse axis and sides of length parallel to the conjugate axis. (See Figure for an example with a horizontal transverse axis.) The diagonals of the rectangle lie on the asymptotes.   Using the asymptotes of a hyperbola as a graphing aid         These lines pass through . When the transverse axis is horizontal, the slopes are ; when the transverse axis is vertical, their slopes are . This gives equations:       Horizontal Transverse Axis Vertical Transverse Axis     .     Graphing a hyperbola   Sketch the hyperbola given by .    Video solution     The hyperbola is centered at ; and . In Figure we draw the prescribed rectangle centered at along with the asymptotes defined by its diagonals. The hyperbola has a vertical transverse axis, so the vertices are located at and . This is enough to make a good sketch.   Graphing the hyperbola in Example         We also find the location of the foci: as , we have . Thus the foci are located at as shown in the figure.     Graphing a hyperbola   Sketch the hyperbola given by .    Video solution     We must complete the square to put the equation in general form. (We recognize this as a hyperbola since it is a general quadratic equation and the and terms have opposite signs.)    Graphing the hyperbola in Example         We see the hyperbola is centered at , with a horizontal transverse axis, where and . The appropriate rectangle is sketched in Figure along with the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The vertices are located at . We have , so the foci are located at as shown in the figure.      Eccentricity   Eccentricity of a Hyperbola   The eccentricity of a hyperbola is . hyperbola eccentricity  eccentricity      Understanding the eccentricity of a hyperbola                                             Note that this is the definition of eccentricity as used for the ellipse. When is close in value to ( , ), the hyperbola is very narrow (looking almost like crossed lines). Figure shows hyperbolas centered at the origin with . The graph in Figure has , giving an eccentricity of , which is close to 1. As grows larger, the hyperbola widens and begins to look like parallel lines, as shown in Figure .    Reflective Property  Hyperbolas share a similar reflective property with ellipses. However, in the case of a hyperbola, a ray emanating from a focus that intersects the hyperbola reflects along a line containing the other focus, but moving away from that focus. This is illustrated in Figure (on the next page). Hyperbolic mirrors are commonly used in telescopes because of this reflective property. It is stated formally in the following theorem.   Reflective Property of Hyperbolas   Let be a point on a hyperbola with foci and . The tangent line to the hyperbola at makes equal angles with the following two lines: hyperbola reflective property      The line through and , and    The line through and .         Location Determination  Determining the location of a known event has many practical uses (locating the epicenter of an earthquake, an airplane crash site, the position of the person speaking in a large room, etc.).  To determine the location of an earthquake's epicenter, seismologists use trilateration (not to be confused with triangulation ). A seismograph allows one to determine how far away the epicenter was; using three separate readings, the location of the epicenter can be approximated.  A key to this method is knowing distances. What if this information is not available? Consider three microphones at positions , and which all record a noise (a person's voice, an explosion, etc.) created at unknown location . The microphone does not know when the sound was created , only when the sound was detected . How can the location be determined in such a situation?   Illustrating the reflective property of a hyperbola         If each location has a clock set to the same time, hyperbolas can be used to determine the location. Suppose the microphone at position records the sound at exactly 12:00, location records the time exactly 1 second later, and location records the noise exactly 2 seconds after that. We are interested in the difference of times. Since the speed of sound is approximately 340 m\/s, we can conclude quickly that the sound was created 340 meters closer to position than position . If and are a known distance apart (as shown in Figure ), then we can determine a hyperbola on which must lie.  The difference of distances is 340; this is also the distance between vertices of the hyperbola. So we know . Positions and lie on the foci, so . From this we can find and can sketch the hyperbola, given in Figure . We only care about the side closest to . (Why?)  We can also find the hyperbola defined by positions and . In this case, as the sound traveled an extra 2 seconds to get to . We still have , centering this hyperbola at . We find . This hyperbola is sketched in Figure . The intersection point of the two graphs is the location of the sound, at approximately .                                    This chapter explores curves in the plane, in particular curves that cannot be described by functions of the form . In this section, we learned of ellipses and hyperbolas that are defined implicitly, not explicitly. In the following sections, we will learn completely new ways of describing curves in the plane, using parametric equations and polar coordinates , then study these curves using calculus techniques.     Terms and Concepts   What is the difference between degenerate and nondegenerate conics?   When defining the conics as the intersections of a plane and a double napped cone, degenerate conics are created when the plane intersects the tips of the cones (usually taken as the origin). Nondegenerate conics are formed when this plane does not contain the origin.    Use your own words to explain what the eccentricity of an ellipse measures.   Answers will vary.    What has the largest eccentricity: an ellipse or a hyperbola?   Hyperbola    Explain why the following is true: If the coefficient of the term in the equation of an ellipse in standard form is smaller than the coefficient of the term, then the ellipse has a horizontal major axis.    With the equation , the ellipse has a horizontal major axis if . But the coefficient of the term is (not ), so if , then and the major axis is horizontal.    Explain how one can quickly look at the equation of a hyperbola in standard form and determine whether the transverse axis is horizontal or vertical.   With a horizontal transverse axis, the term has a positive coefficient; with a vertical transverse axis, the term has a positive coefficient.    Fill in the blank: It can be said that ellipses and hyperbolas share the same reflective property: A ray emanating from one focus will reflect off the conic along a that contains the other focus.    line     Problems    In the following exercises, find the equation of the parabola defined by the given information.

  "body": " Parametric Equations    Video introduction to    We are familiar with sketching shapes, such as parabolas, by following this basic procedure:   Plotting a graph       The rectangular equation  works well for some shapes like a parabola with a vertical axis of symmetry, but in the previous section we encountered several shapes that could not be sketched in this manner. (To plot an ellipse using the above procedure, we need to plot the top and bottom separately.) curve rectangular equation   In this section we introduce a new sketching procedure:   Plotting a curve       Here, and are found separately but then plotted together: for each value of the input , we plot the output - the point .    Plotting parametric curves  The procedure outlined in leads us to a definition.   Parametric Equations and Curves   Let and be continuous functions on an interval . The set of all points in the Cartesian plane, as varies over , is the graph of the parametric equations  and , where is the parameter . A curve is a graph along with the parametric equations that define it. curve parametrically defined  parametric equations definition     This is a formal definition of the word curve . When a curve lies in a plane (such as the Cartesian plane), it is often referred to as a plane curve . Examples will help us understand the concepts introduced in the definition.   Plotting parametric functions   Plot the graph of the parametric equations , for in .    Video solution     We plot the graphs of parametric equations in much the same manner as we plotted graphs of functions like : we make a table of values, plot points, then connect these points with a reasonable looking curve. Figure shows such a table of values; note how we have 3 columns.  The points from the table are plotted in Figure . The points have been connected with a smooth curve. Each point has been labeled with its corresponding -value. These values, along with the two arrows along the curve, are used to indicate the orientation of the graph. This information helps us determine the direction in which the graph is moving.    A table of values of the parametric equations in Example along with a sketch of their graph                                                       We often use the letter as the parameter as we often regard as representing time . Certainly there are many contexts in which the parameter is not time, but it can be helpful to think in terms of time as one makes sense of parametric plots and their orientation (for instance, At time the position is and at time the position is . ).   Plotting parametric functions   Sketch the graph of the parametric equations , for in .    We again start by making a table of values in Figure , then plot the points on the Cartesian plane in Figure .   A table of values of the parametric equations in Example along with a sketch of their graph                                                     It is not difficult to show that the curves in Examples and are portions of the same parabola. While the parabola is the same, the curves are different. In Example , if we let vary over all real numbers, we'd obtain the entire parabola. In this example, letting vary over all real numbers would still produce the same graph; this portion of the parabola would be traced, and re-traced, infinitely many times. The orientation shown in Figure shows the orientation on , but this orientation is reversed on .  These examples begin to illustrate the powerful nature of parametric equations. Their graphs are far more diverse than the graphs of functions produced by functions.     Technology Note: Most graphing utilities can graph functions given in parametric form. Often the word parametric is abbreviated as PAR or PARAM in the options. The user usually needs to determine the graphing window (i.e, the minimum and maximum - and -values), along with the values of that are to be plotted. The user is often prompted to give a minimum, a maximum, and a -step or . Graphing utilities effectively plot parametric functions just as we've shown here: they plots lots of points. A smaller -step plots more points, making for a smoother graph (but may take longer). In Figure , the -step is 1; in Figure , the -step is .  One nice feature of parametric equations is that their graphs are easy to shift. While this is not too difficult in the context, the resulting function can look rather messy. (Plus, to shift to the right by two, we replace with , which is counter-intuitive.) The following example demonstrates this.   Shifting the graph of parametric functions   Sketch the graph of the parametric equations , . Find new parametric equations that shift this graph to the right 3 places and down 2.    The graph of the parametric equations is given in Figure . It is a parabola with a axis of symmetry along the line ; the vertex is at .  In order to shift the graph to the right 3 units, we need to increase the -value by 3 for every point. The straightforward way to accomplish this is simply to add 3 to the function defining : . To shift the graph down by 2 units, we wish to decrease each -value by 2, so we subtract 2 from the function defining : . Thus our parametric equations for the shifted graph are , . This is graphed in Figure . Notice how the vertex is now at .   Illustrating how to shift graphs in Example                         Because the - and -values of a graph are determined independently, the graphs of parametric functions often possess features not seen on type graphs. The next example demonstrates how such graphs can arrive at the same point more than once.   Graphs that cross themselves   Plot the parametric functions and and determine the -values where the graph crosses itself.    Using the methods developed in this section, we again plot points and graph the parametric equations as shown in Figure . It appears that the graph crosses itself at the point , but we'll need to analytically determine this.   A graph of the parametric equations from Example         We are looking for two different values, say, and , where and . That is, the -values are the same precisely when the -values are the same. This gives us a system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns:   Solving this system is not trivial but involves only algebra. Using the quadratic formula, one can solve for in the second equation and find that . This can be substituted into the first equation, revealing that the graph crosses itself at and . We confirm our result by computing and .      Converting between rectangular and parametric equations  It is sometimes useful to rewrite equations in rectangular form ( , ) into parametric form, and vice-versa. Converting from rectangular to parametric can be very simple: given , the parametric equations , produce the same graph. As an example, given , the parametric equations , produce the familiar parabola. However, other parametrizations can be used. The following example demonstrates one possible alternative.   Converting from rectangular to parametric   Consider . Find parametric equations , for the parabola where . That is, corresponds to the point on the graph whose tangent line has slope .    Video solution     We start by computing : . Thus we set . We can solve for and find . Knowing that , we have . Thus parametric equations for the parabola are .  To find the point where the tangent line has a slope of , we set . This gives the point . We can verify that the slope of the line tangent to the curve at this point indeed has a slope of .    We sometimes choose the parameter to accurately model physical behavior.   Converting from rectangular to parametric   An object is fired from a height of 0 feet and lands 6 seconds later, 192 feet away. Assuming ideal projectile motion, the height, in feet, of the object can be described by , where is the distance in feet from the initial location. (Thus feet.) Find parametric equations , for the path of the projectile where is the horizontal distance the object has traveled at time (in seconds) and is the height at time .    Physics tells us that the horizontal motion of the projectile is linear; that is, the horizontal speed of the projectile is constant. Since the object travels 192 in 6 , we deduce that the object is moving horizontally at a rate of 32 , giving the equation . As , we find . We can quickly verify that  , the acceleration due to gravity, and that the projectile reaches its maximum at , halfway along its path.  These parametric equations make certain determinations about the object's location easy: 2 seconds into the flight the object is at the point . That is, it has traveled horizontally 64 and is at a height of 128 , as shown in Figure .   Graphing projectile motion in Example           It is sometimes necessary to convert given parametric equations into rectangular form. This can be decidedly more difficult, as some simple looking parametric equations can have very complicated rectangular equations. This conversion is often referred to as eliminating the parameter, as we are looking for a relationship between and that does not involve the parameter .   Eliminating the parameter   Find a rectangular equation for the curve described by .    Video solution     There is not a set way to eliminate a parameter. One method is to solve for in one equation and then substitute that value in the second. We use that technique here, then show a second, simpler method.  Starting with , solve for : . Substitute this value for in the equation for : .   Graphing parametric and rectangular equations for a graph in Example         Thus . One may have recognized this earlier by manipulating the equation for : .  This is a shortcut that is very specific to this problem; sometimes shortcuts exist and are worth looking for.  We should be careful to limit the domain of the function . The parametric equations limit to values in , thus to produce the same graph we should limit the domain of to the same.  The graphs of these functions is given in Figure . The portion of the graph defined by the parametric equations is given in a thick line; the graph defined by with unrestricted domain is given in a thin line.     Eliminating the parameter   Eliminate the parameter in ,     Video solution     We should not try to solve for in this situation as the resulting algebra\/trig would be messy. Rather, we solve for and in each equation, respectively. This gives .  The Pythagorean Theorem gives , so:    Graphing the parametric equations , in Example         This final equation should look familiar it is the equation of an ellipse! Figure plots the parametric equations, demonstrating that the graph is indeed of an ellipse with a horizontal major axis and center at .    The Pythagorean Theorem can also be used to identify parametric equations for hyperbolas. We give the parametric equations for ellipses and hyperbolas in the following Key Idea.   Parametric Equations of Ellipses and Hyperbolas     The parametric equations define an ellipse with horizontal axis of length and vertical axis of length , centered at . ellipse parametric equations     The parametric equations define a hyperbola with vertical transverse axis centered at , and defines a hyperbola with horizontal transverse axis. Each has asymptotes at .  hyperbola parametric equations          Special Curves   Figure gives a small gallery of interesting and famous curves along with parametric equations that produce them. Interested readers can begin learning more about these curves through internet searches.  One might note a feature shared by two of these graphs: sharp corners, or cusps . We have seen graphs with cusps before and determined that such functions are not differentiable at these points. This leads us to a definition.   A gallery of interesting planar curves      Astroid where and          Rose Curve where and            Hypotrochoid where and          Epicycloid where and            Smooth   A curve defined by , is smooth on an interval if and are continuous on and not simultaneously 0 (except possibly at the endpoints of ). A curve is piecewise smooth on if can be partitioned into subintervals where is smooth on each subinterval. curve smooth  smooth curve  cusp     Consider the astroid, given by , . Taking derivatives, we have: .  It is clear that each is 0 when . Thus the astroid is not smooth at these points, corresponding to the cusps seen in the figure.  We demonstrate this once more.   Determine where a curve is not smooth   Let a curve be defined by the parametric equations and . Determine the points, if any, where it is not smooth.    Video solution     We begin by taking derivatives. .  We set each equal to 0:   We see at both and are 0; thus is not smooth at , corresponding to the point . The curve is graphed in Figure , illustrating the cusp at .   Graphing the curve in Example ; note it is not smooth at           If a curve is not smooth at , it means that as defined. This, in turn, means that rate of change of (and ) is 0; that is, at that instant, neither nor is changing. If the parametric equations describe the path of some object, this means the object is at rest at . An object at rest can make a sharp change in direction, whereas moving objects tend to change direction in a smooth fashion.  One should be careful to note that a sharp corner does not have to occur when a curve is not smooth. For instance, one can verify that , produce the familiar parabola. However, in this parametrization, the curve is not smooth. A particle traveling along the parabola according to the given parametric equations comes to rest at , though no sharp point is created.  Our previous experience with cusps taught us that a function was not differentiable at a cusp. This can lead us to wonder about derivatives in the context of parametric equations and the application of other calculus concepts. Given a curve defined parametrically, how do we find the slopes of tangent lines? Can we determine concavity? We explore these concepts and more in the next section.

  "body": " Calculus and Parametric Equations   The previous section defined curves based on parametric equations. In this section we'll employ the techniques of calculus to study these curves.  We are still interested in lines tangent to points on a curve. They describe how the -values are changing with respect to the -values, they are useful in making approximations, and they indicate instantaneous direction of travel.   Video introduction to    The slope of the tangent line is still , and the Chain Rule allows us to calculate this in the context of parametric equations. If and , the Chain Rule states that .  Solving for , we get , provided that . This is important so we label it a Key Idea.   Finding with Parametric Equations  Let and , where and are differentiable on some open interval and on . Then parametric equations finding  derivative parametric equations  .   We use this to define the tangent line.   Tangent and Normal Lines   Let a curve be parametrized by and , where and are differentiable functions on some interval containing . The tangent line to at is the line through with slope , provided .  The normal line to at is the line through with slope , provided . tangent line  normal line  parametric equations tangent line  parametric equations normal line     The definition leaves two special cases to consider. When the tangent line is horizontal, the normal line is undefined by the above definition as . Likewise, when the normal line is horizontal, the tangent line is undefined. It seems reasonable that these lines be defined (one can draw a line tangent to the right side of a circle, for instance), so we add the following to the above definition.     If the tangent line at has a slope of 0, the normal line to at is the line .    If the normal line at has a slope of 0, the tangent line to at is the line .      Tangent and Normal Lines to Curves   Let and , and let be the curve defined by these equations.     Find the equations of the tangent and normal lines to at .    Find where has vertical and horizontal tangent lines.       Video solution        We start by computing and . Thus . Make note of something that might seem unusual: is a function of , not . Just as points on the curve are found in terms of , so are the slopes of the tangent lines. The point on at is . The slope of the tangent line is and the slope of the normal line is . Thus,   the equation of the tangent line is , and    the equation of the normal line is .     This is illustrated in Figure .   Graphing tangent and normal lines in Example           To find where has a horizontal tangent line, we set and solve for . In this case, this amounts to setting and solving for (and making sure that ). . The point on corresponding to is ; the tangent line at that point is horizontal (hence with equation ). To find where has a vertical tangent line, we find where it has a horizontal normal line, and set . This amounts to setting and solving for (and making sure that ). . The point on corresponding to is . The tangent line at that point is . The points where the tangent lines are vertical and horizontal are indicated on the graph in Figure .        Tangent and Normal Lines to a Circle      Find where the unit circle, defined by and on , has vertical and horizontal tangent lines.    Find the equation of the normal line at .       Video solution        We compute the derivative following Key Idea : . The derivative is when ; that is, when . These are the points and on the circle. The normal line is horizontal (and hence, the tangent line is vertical) when ; that is, when , corresponding to the points and on the circle. These results should make intuitive sense.    The slope of the normal line at is . This normal line goes through the point , giving the line , as long as . It is an important fact to recognize that the normal lines to a circle pass through its center, as illustrated in Figure . Stated in another way, any line that passes through the center of a circle intersects the circle at right angles.   Illustrating how a circle's normal lines pass through its center               Tangent lines when is not defined   Find the equation of the tangent line to the astroid , at , shown in Figure .   A graph of an astroid           Video solution     We start by finding and : .  Note that both of these are 0 at ; the curve is not smooth at forming a cusp on the graph. Evaluating at this point returns the indeterminate form of 0\/0 .  We can, however, examine the slopes of tangent lines near , and take the limit as . .  We have accomplished something significant. When the derivative returns an indeterminate form at , we can define its value by setting it to be , if that limit exists. This allows us to find slopes of tangent lines at cusps, which can be very beneficial.  We found the slope of the tangent line at to be 0; therefore the tangent line is , the -axis.      Concavity  We continue to analyze curves in the plane by considering their concavity; that is, we are interested in , the second derivative of with respect to . To find this, we need to find the derivative of with respect to ; that is, , but recall that is a function of , not , making this computation not straightforward. concavity  parametric equations concavity   To make the upcoming notation a bit simpler, let . We want ; that is, we want . We again appeal to the Chain Rule. Note: .  In words, to find , we first take the derivative of  with respect to , then divide by . We restate this as a Key Idea.   Finding with Parametric Equations  Let and be twice differentiable functions on an open interval , where on . Then parametric equations finding  .   Examples will help us understand this Key Idea.   Concavity of Plane Curves   Let and as in Example . Determine the -intervals on which the graph is concave up\/down.    Video solution     Concavity is determined by the second derivative of with respect to , , so we compute that here following Key Idea .  In Example , we found and . So:    Graphing the parametric equations in Example to demonstrate concavity         The graph of the parametric functions is concave up when and concave down when . We determine the intervals when the second derivative is greater\/less than 0 by first finding when it is 0 or undefined.  As the numerator of is never 0, for all . It is undefined when ; that is, when . Following the work established in Section , we look at values of greater\/less than on a number line:      Reviewing Example , we see that when , the graph of the parametric equations has a vertical tangent line. This point is also a point of inflection for the graph, illustrated in Figure .  The video in Figure shows how this information can be used to sketch the curve by hand.   Sketching the curve in       Concavity of Plane Curves   Find the points of inflection of the graph of the parametric equations , , for .    We need to compute and . . .  The points of inflection are found by setting . This is not trivial, as equations that mix polynomials and trigonometric functions generally do not have nice solutions.  In Figure we see a plot of the second derivative. It shows that it has zeros at approximately and . These approximations are not very good, made only by looking at the graph. Newton's Method provides more accurate approximations. Accurate to 2 decimal places, we have: .  The corresponding points have been plotted on the graph of the parametric equations in Figure . Note how most occur near the -axis, but not exactly on the axis.   In (a), a graph of , showing where it is approximately 0. In (b), graph of the parametric equations in Example along with the points of inflection                           Arc Length  We continue our study of the features of the graphs of parametric equations by computing their arc length.   Video introduction to arc length for parametric curves    Recall in Section we found the arc length of the graph of a function, from to , to be .  We can use this equation and convert it to the parametric equation context. Letting and , we know that . It will also be useful to calculate the differential of : .  Starting with the arc length formula above, consider: .  Note the new bounds (no longer bounds, but bounds). They are found by finding and such that and . This formula is important, so we restate it as a theorem.   Arc Length of Parametric Curves   Let and be parametric equations with and continuous on , on which the graph traces itself only once. The arc length of the graph, from to , is parametric equations arc length  arc length  .      Note:  Theorem makes use of differentiability on closed intervals, just as was done in Section .   As before, these integrals are often not easy to compute. We start with a simple example, then give another where we approximate the solution.   Arc Length of a Circle   Find the arc length of the circle parametrized by , on .    Video solution     By direct application of Theorem , we have .  This should make sense; we know from geometry that the circumference of a circle with radius 3 is ; since we are finding the arc length of of a circle, the arc length is .     Arc Length of a Parametric Curve   The graph of the parametric equations , crosses itself as shown in Figure , forming a teardrop. Find the arc length of the teardrop.   A graph of the parametric equations in Example , where the arc length of the teardrop is calculated           Video solution     We can see by the parametrizations of and that when , and . This means we'll integrate from to . Applying Theorem , we have .  Unfortunately, the integrand does not have an antiderivative expressible by elementary functions. We turn to numerical integration to approximate its value. Using 4 subintervals, Simpson's Rule approximates the value of the integral as . Using a computer, more subintervals are easy to employ, and gives a value of . Increasing shows that this value is stable and a good approximation of the actual value.      Surface Area of a Solid of Revolution  Related to the formula for finding arc length is the formula for finding surface area. We can adapt the formula found in Theorem from Section in a similar way as done to produce the formula for arc length done before.   Surface Area of a Solid of Revolution   Consider the graph of the parametric equations and , where and are continuous on an open interval containing and on which the graph does not cross itself. surface area solid of revolution  integration surface area  parametric equations surface area      The surface area of the solid formed by revolving the graph about the -axis is (where on ): .    The surface area of the solid formed by revolving the graph about the -axis is (where on ): .        Surface Area of a Solid of Revolution   Consider the teardrop shape formed by the parametric equations , as seen in Example . Find the surface area if this shape is rotated about the -axis, as shown in Figure .   Rotating a teardrop shape about the -axis in Example           The teardrop shape is formed between and . Using Theorem , we see we need for on , and this is not the case. To fix this, we simplify replace with , which flips the whole graph about the -axis (and does not change the surface area of the resulting solid). The surface area is: .  Once again we arrive at an integral that we cannot compute in terms of elementary functions. Using Simpson's Rule with , we find the area to be . Using larger values of shows this is accurate to 2 places after the decimal.    After defining a new way of creating curves in the plane, in this section we have applied calculus techniques to the parametric equation defining these curves to study their properties. In the next section, we define another way of forming curves in the plane. To do so, we create a new coordinate system, called polar coordinates , that identifies points in the plane in a manner different than from measuring distances from the - and - axes.

  "title": "Introduction to Polar Coordinates",
  "body": " Introduction to Polar Coordinates    Video introduction to    We are generally introduced to the idea of graphing curves by relating -values to -values through a function . That is, we set , and plot lots of point pairs to get a good notion of how the curve looks. This method is useful but has limitations, not least of which is that curves that fail the vertical line test cannot be graphed without using multiple functions.  The previous two sections introduced and studied a new way of plotting points in the -plane. Using parametric equations, and values are computed independently and then plotted together. This method allows us to graph an extraordinary range of curves. This section introduces yet another way to plot points in the plane: using polar coordinates .    Polar Coordinates  Start with a point in the plane called the pole (we will always identify this point with the origin). From the pole, draw a ray, called the initial ray (we will always draw this ray horizontally, identifying it with the positive -axis). A point in the plane is determined by the distance that is from , and the angle formed between the initial ray and the segment (measured counter-clockwise). We record the distance and angle as an ordered pair . To avoid confusion with rectangular coordinates, we will denote polar coordinates with the letter , as in . This is illustrated in Figure  polar coordinates  polar coordinates  coordinates polar    Illustrating polar coordinates       Practice will make this process more clear.   Plotting Polar Coordinates   Plot the following polar coordinates: polar coordinates plotting points      To aid in the drawing, a polar grid is provided below. To place the point , go out 1 unit along the initial ray (putting you on the inner circle shown on the grid), then rotate counter-clockwise radians (or ). Alternately, one can consider the rotation first: think about the ray from that forms an angle of with the initial ray, then move out 1 unit along this ray (again placing you on the inner circle of the grid).      To plot , go out units along the initial ray and rotate radians ( ).  To plot , go out 2 units along the initial ray then rotate clockwise  radians, as the angle given is negative.  To plot , move along the initial ray units in other words, back up 1 unit, then rotate counter-clockwise by . The results are given in Figure .   Plotting polar points in Example           Consider the following two points: and . To locate , go out 1 unit on the initial ray then rotate radians; to locate , go out units on the initial ray and don't rotate. One should see that and are located at the same point in the plane. We can also consider , or ; all four of these points share the same location.  This ability to identify a point in the plane with multiple polar coordinates is both a blessing and a curse. We will see that it is beneficial as we can plot beautiful functions that intersect themselves (much like we saw with parametric functions). The unfortunate part of this is that it can be difficult to determine when this happens. We'll explore this more later in this section.    Polar to Rectangular Conversion  It is useful to recognize both the rectangular (or, Cartesian) coordinates of a point in the plane and its polar coordinates. Figure shows a point in the plane with rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates . Using trigonometry, we can make the identities given in the following Key Idea.   Converting between rectangular and polar coordinates          Converting Between Rectangular and Polar Coordinates  Given the polar point , the rectangular coordinates are determined by .  Given the rectangular coordinates , the polar coordinates are determined by .    Converting Between Polar and Rectangular Coordinates      Convert the polar coordinates and to rectangular coordinates.    Convert the rectangular coordinates and to polar coordinates.             We start with . Using Key Idea , we have . So the rectangular coordinates are .    The polar point is converted to rectangular with: . So the rectangular coordinates are .     These points are plotted in Figure . The rectangular coordinate system is drawn lightly under the polar coordinate system so that the relationship between the two can be seen.   Plotting rectangular and polar points in Example                            To convert the rectangular point to polar coordinates, we use the Key Idea to form the following two equations: . The first equation tells us that . Using the inverse tangent function, we find . Thus polar coordinates of are .    To convert to polar coordinates, we form the equations . Thus . We need to be careful in computing : using the inverse tangent function, we have . This is not the angle we desire. The range of is ; that is, it returns angles that lie in the st and th quadrants. To find locations in the nd and rd quadrants, add to the result of . So puts the angle at . Thus the polar point is . An alternate method is to use the angle given by arctangent, but change the sign of . Thus we could also refer to as .     These points are plotted in Figure . The polar system is drawn lightly under the rectangular grid with rays to demonstrate the angles used.         Polar Functions and Polar Graphs  Defining a new coordinate system allows us to create a new kind of function, a polar function. Rectangular coordinates lent themselves well to creating functions that related and , such as . Polar coordinates allow us to create functions that relate and . Normally these functions look like , although we can create functions of the form . The following examples introduce us to this concept. polar functions  polar functions!graphing    Introduction to Graphing Polar Functions   Describe the graphs of the following polar functions.                  Video solution        The equation describes all points that are 1.5 units from the pole; as the angle is not specified, any is allowable. All points 1.5 units from the pole describes a circle of radius 1.5. We can consider the rectangular equivalent of this equation; using , we see that , which we recognize as the equation of a circle centered at with radius 1.5. This is sketched in Figure .    The equation describes all points such that the line through them and the pole make an angle of with the initial ray. As the radius is not specified, it can be any value (even negative). Thus describes the line through the pole that makes an angle of with the initial ray. We can again consider the rectangular equivalent of this equation. Combine and : . This graph is also plotted in Figure .   Plotting standard polar plots              The basic rectangular equations of the form and create vertical and horizontal lines, respectively; the basic polar equations and create circles and lines through the pole, respectively. With this as a foundation, we can create more complicated polar functions of the form . The input is an angle; the output is a length, how far in the direction of the angle to go out.  We sketch these functions much like we sketch rectangular and parametric functions: we plot lots of points and connect the dots with curves. We demonstrate this in the following example.   Sketching Polar Functions   Sketch the polar function on by plotting points.    Video solution     A common question when sketching curves by plotting points is Which points should I plot? With rectangular equations, we often choose easy values integers, then add more if needed. When plotting polar equations, start with the common angles multiples of and . Figure gives a table of just a few values of in .  Consider the point determined by the first line of the table. The angle is 0 radians we do not rotate from the initial ray then we go out 2 units from the pole. When , (actually, it is ); so rotate by radians and go out 1.866 units.  The graph shown uses more points, connected with straight lines. (The points on the graph that correspond to points in the table are signified with larger dots.) Such a sketch is likely good enough to give one an idea of what the graph looks like.   Graphing a polar function in Example by plotting points                                       Technology Note: Plotting functions in this way can be tedious, just as it was with rectangular functions. To obtain very accurate graphs, technology is a great aid. Most graphing calculators can plot polar functions; in the menu, set the plotting mode to something like polar or POL , depending on one's calculator. As with plotting parametric functions, the viewing window no longer determines the -values that are plotted, so additional information needs to be provided. Often with the window settings are the settings for the beginning and ending values (often called and ) as well as the  that is, how far apart the values are spaced. The smaller the value, the more accurate the graph (which also increases plotting time). Using technology, we graphed the polar function from Example in Figure .   Using technology to graph a polar function          Sketching Polar Functions   Sketch the polar function on by plotting points.    Video solution     We start by making a table of evaluated at common angles , as shown in Figure . These points are then plotted in Figure . This particular graph moves around quite a bit and one can easily forget which points should be connected to each other. To help us with this, we numbered each point in the table and on the graph.   Table of points for plotting a polar curve in   Pt.                     Using more points (and the aid of technology) a smoother plot can be made as shown in Figure . This plot is an example of a rose curve .   Polar plots from Example                         It is sometimes desirable to refer to a graph via a polar equation, and other times by a rectangular equation. Therefore it is necessary to be able to convert between polar and rectangular functions, which we practice in the following example. We will make frequent use of the identities found in Key Idea .   Converting between rectangular and polar equations    Convert from rectangular to polar.              Convert from polar to rectangular.                 Video solution        Replace with and replace with , giving: We have found that . The domain of this polar function is ; plot a few points to see how the familiar parabola is traced out by the polar equation.    We again replace and using the standard identities and work to solve for : This function is valid only when the product of is positive. This occurs in the first and third quadrants, meaning the domain of this polar function is . We can rewrite the original rectangular equation as . This is graphed in Figure ; note how it only exists in the first and third quadrants.   Graphing from Example           There is no set way to convert from polar to rectangular; in general, we look to form the products and , and then replace these with and , respectively. We start in this problem by multiplying both sides by : . The original polar equation, does not easily reveal that its graph is simply a line. However, our conversion shows that it is. The upcoming gallery of polar curves gives the general equations of lines in polar form.    By multiplying both sides by , we obtain both an term and an term, which we replace with and , respectively. . The circle is centered at and has radius 1. The upcoming gallery of polar curves gives the equations of some circles in polar form; circles with arbitrary centers have a complicated polar equation that we do not consider here.       Some curves have very simple polar equations but rather complicated rectangular ones. For instance, the equation describes a cardioid (a shape important the sensitivity of microphones, among other things; one is graphed in the gallery in the Limaçon section). It's rectangular form is not nearly as simple; it is the implicit equation . The conversion is not hard, but takes several steps, and is left as a problem in the Exercise section.   Gallery of Polar Curves   There are a number of basic and classic polar curves, famous for their beauty and\/or applicability to the sciences. polar function!gallery of graphs This section ends with a small gallery of some of these graphs. We encourage the reader to understand how these graphs are formed, and to investigate with technology other types of polar functions.   Lines        Through the origin:          Horizontal line:            Vertical line:          Not through origin:             Circles and Spirals        Centered on -axis:          Centered on -axis:            Centered on origin:          Archimedean spiral:             Limaçons   Symmetric about -axis:   Symmetric about -axis: ;        With inner loop:          Cardioid:            Dimpled:          Convex:             Rose Curves   Symmetric about -axis:   Symmetric about -axis:   Curve contains petals when is even and petals when is odd.                                                Special Curves        Rose curve:          Rose curve:            Lemniscate:          Eight Curve:            Earlier we discussed how each point in the plane does not have a unique representation in polar form. This can be a good thing, as it allows for the beautiful and interesting curves seen in the preceding gallery. However, it can also be a bad thing, as it can be difficult to determine where two curves intersect.   Finding points of intersection with polar curves   Determine where the graphs of the polar equations and intersect.    Video solution     As technology is generally readily available, it is usually a good idea to start with a graph. We have graphed the two functions in Figure ; to better discern the intersection points, Figure zooms in around the origin.   Graphs to help determine the points of intersection of the polar functions given in Example                       We start by setting the two functions equal to each other and solving for : .  (There are, of course, infinite solutions to the equation ; as the limaçon is traced out once on , we restrict our solutions to this interval.)  We need to analyze this solution. When we obtain the point of intersection that lies in the th quadrant. When , we get the point of intersection that lies in the second quadrant. There is more to say about this second intersection point, however. The circle defined by is traced out once on , meaning that this point of intersection occurs while tracing out the circle a second time. It seems strange to pass by the point once and then recognize it as a point of intersection only when arriving there a second time. The first time the circle arrives at this point is when . It is key to understand that these two points are the same: and .  To summarize what we have done so far, we have found two points of intersection: when and when . When referencing the circle , the latter point is better referenced as when .  There is yet another point of intersection: the pole (or, the origin). We did not recognize this intersection point using our work above as each graph arrives at the pole at a different value.  A graph intersects the pole when . Considering the circle , when (and odd multiples thereof, as the circle is repeatedly traced). The limaçon intersects the pole when ; this occurs when , or for . This is a nonstandard angle, approximately . The limaçon intersects the pole twice in ; the other angle at which the limaçon is at the pole is the reflection of the first angle across the -axis. That is, .    If all one is concerned with is the coordinates at which the graphs intersect, much of the above work is extraneous. We know they intersect at ; we might not care at what value. Likewise, using and can give us the needed rectangular coordinates. However, in the next section we apply calculus concepts to polar functions. When computing the area of a region bounded by polar curves, understanding the nuances of the points of intersection becomes important.

When we obtain the point of intersection that lies in the th quadrant. When , we get the point of intersection that lies in the second quadrant. There is more to say about this second intersection point, however. The circle defined by is traced out once on , meaning that this point of intersection occurs while tracing out the circle a second time. It seems strange to pass by the point once and then recognize it as a point of intersection only when arriving there a second time. The first time the circle arrives at this point is when . It is key to understand that these two points are the same: and .  To summarize what we have done so far, we have found two points of intersection: when and when . When referencing the circle , the latter point is better referenced as when .  There is yet another point of intersection: the pole (or, the origin).

  "body": " Calculus and Polar Functions    Video introduction to    The previous section defined polar coordinates, leading to polar functions. We investigated plotting these functions and solving a fundamental question about their graphs, namely, where do two polar graphs intersect?  We now turn our attention to answering other questions, whose solutions require the use of calculus. A basis for much of what is done in this section is the ability to turn a polar function into a set of parametric equations. Using the identities and , we can create the parametric equations , and apply the concepts of Section .    Polar Functions and  We are interested in the lines tangent to a given graph, regardless of whether that graph is produced by rectangular, parametric, or polar equations. In each of these contexts, the slope of the tangent line is . Given , we are generally not concerned with ; that describes how fast changes with respect to . Instead, we will use , to compute .  Using Key Idea we have .  Each of the two derivatives on the right hand side of the equality requires the use of the Product Rule. We state the important result as a Key Idea.   Finding with Polar Functions  Let be a polar function. With and , polar functions!finding  tangent line  .    Finding with polar functions   Consider the limaçon on .     Find the equations of the tangent and normal lines to the graph at .    Find where the graph has vertical and horizontal tangent lines.       Video solution        We start by computing . With , we have . When , (this requires a bit of simplification). In rectangular coordinates, the point on the graph at is . Thus the rectangular equation of the line tangent to the limaçon at is . The limaçon and the tangent line are graphed in Figure . The normal line has the opposite-reciprocal slope as the tangent line, so its equation is .   The limaçon in Example with its tangent line at and points of vertical and horizontal tangency           To find the horizontal lines of tangency, we find where ; thus we find where the numerator of our equation for is 0. . On , when . Setting gives . We want the results in ; we also recognize there are two solutions, one in the third quadrant and one in the fourth. Using reference angles, we have our two solutions as and radians. The four points we obtained where the limaçon has a horizontal tangent line are given in Figure with black-filled dots. To find the vertical lines of tangency, we set the denominator of . . We solve and : In each of the solutions above, we only get one of the possible two solutions as only returns solutions in , the th and st quadrants. Again using reference angles, we have: and These points are also shown in Figure with white-filled dots.       When the graph of the polar function intersects the pole, it means that for some angle . Thus the formula for in such instances is very simple, reducing simply to .  This equation makes an interesting point. It tells us the slope of the tangent line at the pole is ; some of our previous work (see, for instance, Example ) shows us that the line through the pole with slope has polar equation . Thus when a polar graph touches the pole at , the equation of the tangent line at the pole is .   Finding tangent lines at the pole   Let , a limaçon. Find the equations of the lines tangent to the graph at the pole.    Video solution     We need to know when . .  Thus the equations of the tangent lines, in polar, are and . In rectangular form, the tangent lines are and . The full limaçon can be seen in Figure ; we zoom in on the tangent lines in Figure .   Graphing the tangent lines at the pole in Example             Area  When using rectangular coordinates, the equations and defined vertical and horizontal lines, respectively, and combinations of these lines create rectangles (hence the name rectangular coordinates ). It is then somewhat natural to use rectangles to approximate area as we did when learning about the definite integral. polar functions!area   When using polar coordinates, the equations and form lines through the origin and circles centered at the origin, respectively, and combinations of these curves form sectors of circles. It is then somewhat natural to calculate the area of regions defined by polar functions by first approximating with sectors of circles.  Consider Figure where a region defined by on is given. (Note how the sides of the region are the lines and , whereas in rectangular coordinates the sides of regions were often the vertical lines and .)   Recall that the area of a sector of a circle with radius subtended by an angle is .       Partition the interval into equally spaced subintervals as . The length of each subinterval is , representing a small change in angle. The area of the region defined by the th subinterval can be approximated with a sector of a circle with radius , for some in . The area of this sector is . This is shown in Figure , where has been divided into 4 subintervals. We approximate the area of the whole region by summing the areas of all sectors: .  This is a Riemann sum. By taking the limit of the sum as , we find the exact area of the region in the form of a definite integral.   Computing the area of a polar region                        Video presentation of     Area of a Polar Region   Let be continuous and non-negative on , where . The area of the region bounded by the curve and the lines and is     The theorem states that . This ensures that region does not overlap itself, which would give a result that does not correspond directly to the area.   Area of a polar region   Find the area of the circle defined by . (Recall this circle has radius .)    Video solution     This is a direct application of Theorem . The circle is traced out on , leading to the integral .  Of course, we already knew the area of a circle with radius . We did this example to demonstrate that the area formula is correct.      Example requires the use of the integral . This is handled well by using the power reducing formula as found in Section of the Appendix. Due to the nature of the area formula, integrating and is required often. We offer here these indefinite integrals as a time-saving measure.     Area of a polar region   Find the area of the cardioid bound between and , as shown in Figure .   Finding the area of the shaded region of a cardioid in Example           Video solution     This is again a direct application of Theorem . .     Area Between Curves  Our study of area in the context of rectangular functions led naturally to finding area bounded between curves. We consider the same in the context of polar functions. polar functions!area between curves   Consider the shaded region shown in Figure . We can find the area of this region by computing the area bounded by and subtracting the area bounded by on . Thus .   Illustrating area bound between two polar curves          Area Between Polar Curves  The area of the region bounded by and , and , where on , is .    Area between polar curves   Find the area bounded between the curves and , as shown in Figure .   Finding the area between polar curves in Example           Video solution     We need to find the points of intersection between these two functions. Setting them equal to each other, we find:   Thus we integrate on . .  Amazingly enough, the area between these curves has a nice value.     Area defined by polar curves   Find the area bounded between the polar curves and , as shown in Figure .   The region bounded by the functions in Example         Video solution     We need to find the point of intersection between the two curves. Setting the two functions equal to each other, we have .   Breaking the region bounded by the functions in Example into its component parts       In Figure , we zoom in on the region and note that it is not really bounded between two polar curves, but rather by two polar curves, along with . The dashed line breaks the region into its component parts. Below the dashed line, the region is defined by , and . (Note: the dashed line lies on the line .) Above the dashed line the region is bounded by and . Since we have two separate regions, we find the area using two separate integrals.  Call the area below the dashed line and the area above the dashed line . They are determined by the following integrals: .  (The upper bound of the integral computing is as is at the pole when .)  We omit the integration details and let the reader verify that and ; the total area is .       Arc Length  As we have already considered the arc length of curves defined by rectangular and parametric equations, we now consider it in the context of polar equations. Recall that the arc length of the graph defined by the parametric equations , on is arc length  polar function!arc length  .  Now consider the polar function . We again use the identities and to create parametric equations based on the polar function. We compute and as done before when computing , then apply Equation .  The expression can be simplified a great deal; we leave this as an exercise and state that .  This leads us to the arc length formula.   Arc Length of Polar Curves   Let be a polar function with continuous on , on which the graph traces itself only once. The arc length of the graph on is .     Arc length of a limaçon   Find the arc length of the limaçon .    Video solution     With , we have . The limaçon is traced out once on , giving us our bounds of integration. Applying Theorem , we have .   The limaçon in Example whose arc length is measured         The final integral cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions, so we resorted to a numerical approximation. (Simpson's Rule, with , approximates the value with . Using gives the value above, which is accurate to 4 places after the decimal.)      Surface Area  The formula for arc length leads us to a formula for surface area. The following Theorem is based on Theorem .   Surface Area of a Solid of Revolution   Consider the graph of the polar equation , where is continuous on , on which the graph does not cross itself. surface area solid of revolution  polar function!surface area  integration surface area      The surface area of the solid formed by revolving the graph about the initial ray ( ) is: .

Using Theorem and the fact that , we have .  The integral is another that cannot be evaluated in terms of elementary functions. Simpson's Rule, with , approximates the value at .    This chapter has been about curves in the plane. While there is great mathematics to be discovered in the two dimensions of a plane, we live in a three dimensional world and hence we should also look to do mathematics in 3D that is, in space . The next chapter begins our exploration into space by introducing the topic of vectors , which are incredibly useful and powerful mathematical objects.

  "title": "Introduction to Cartesian Coordinates in Space",
  "body": " Introduction to Cartesian Coordinates in Space   Up to this point in this text we have considered mathematics in a 2-dimensional world. We have plotted graphs on the -plane using rectangular and polar coordinates and found the area of regions in the plane. We have considered properties of solid objects, such as volume and surface area, but only by first defining a curve in the plane and then rotating it out of the plane.  While there is wonderful mathematics to explore in 2D, we live in a 3D world and eventually we will want to apply mathematics involving this third dimension. In this section we introduce Cartesian coordinates in space and explore basic surfaces. This will lay a foundation for much of what we do in the remainder of the text.   Video introduction to    Each point in space can be represented with an ordered triple, , where , and represent the relative position of along the -, - and -axes, respectively. Each axis is perpendicular to the other two.  Visualizing points in space on paper can be problematic, as we are trying to represent a 3-dimensional concept on a 2-dimensional medium. We cannot draw three lines representing the three axes in which each line is perpendicular to the other two. Despite this issue, standard conventions exist for plotting shapes in space that we will discuss that are more than adequate.  One convention is that the axes must conform to the right hand rule . This rule states that when the index finger of the right hand is extended in the direction of the positive -axis, and the middle finger (bent inward so it is perpendicular to the palm) points along the positive -axis, then the extended thumb will point in the direction of the positive -axis. (It may take some thought to verify this, but this system is inherently different from the one created by using the left hand rule. ) right hand rule of Cartesian coordinates   As long as the coordinate axes are positioned so that they follow this rule, it does not matter how the axes are drawn on paper. There are two popular methods that we briefly discuss.   Plotting the point in space         In Figure we see the point plotted on a set of axes. The basic convention here is that the -plane is drawn in its standard way, with the -axis down to the left. The perspective is that the paper represents the -plane and the positive axis is coming up, off the page. This method is preferred by many engineers. Because it can be hard to tell where a single point lies in relation to all the axes, dashed lines have been added to let one see how far along each axis the point lies.  One can also consider the -plane as being a horizontal plane in, say, a room, where the positive -axis is pointing up. When one steps back and looks at this room, one might draw the axes as shown in Figure . The same point is drawn, again with dashed lines. This point of view is preferred by most mathematicians, and is the convention adopted by this text.  Just as the - and -axes divide the plane into four quadrants , the -, -, and -coordinate planes divide space into eight octants . The octant in which , , and are positive is called the first octant . We do not name the other seven octants in this text. octant first  first octant    Plotting the point in space with a perspective used in this text           Measuring Distances  It is of critical importance to know how to measure distances between points in space. The formula for doing so is based on measuring distance in the plane, and is known (in both contexts) as the Euclidean measure of distance.   Distance In Space   Let and be points in space. The distance between and is distance between points in space  .    We refer to the line segment that connects points and in space as , and refer to the length of this segment as . The above distance formula allows us to compute the length of this segment.   Video presentation of     Length of a line segment   Let and let . Draw the line segment and find its length.    Video solution     The points and are plotted in Figure ; no special consideration need be made to draw the line segment connecting these two points; simply connect them with a straight line. One cannot actually measure this line on the page and deduce anything meaningful; its true length must be measured analytically. Applying Definition , we have .   Plotting points and in Example             Spheres  Just as a circle is the set of all points in the plane equidistant from a given point (its center), a sphere is the set of all points in space that are equidistant from a given point. Definition allows us to write an equation of the sphere. sphere   We start with a point which is to be the center of a sphere with radius . If a point lies on the sphere, then is units from ; that is, .  Squaring both sides, we get the standard equation of a sphere in space with center at with radius , as given in the following Key Idea.   Standard Equation of a Sphere in Space  The standard equation of the sphere with radius , centered at , is .    Video presentation of     Equation of a sphere   Find the center and radius of the sphere defined by .    Video solution     To determine the center and radius, we must put the equation in standard form. This requires us to complete the square (three times).   The sphere is centered at and has a radius of 4.    The equation of a sphere is an example of an implicit function defining a surface in space. In the case of a sphere, the variables , and are all used. We now consider situations where surfaces are defined where one or two of these variables are absent.    Introduction to Planes in Space  The coordinate axes naturally define three planes (shown in ), the coordinate planes : the -plane, the -plane and the -plane. The -plane is characterized as the set of all points in space where the -value is 0. planes coordinate plane  planes introduction This, in fact, gives us an equation that describes this plane: . Likewise, the -plane is all points where the -value is 0, characterized by .   Video introduction to     The -plane in (a), the -plane in (b) and the -plane in (c)                                The equation describes all points in space where the -value is 2. This is a plane, parallel to the -coordinate plane, shown in Figure .   The plane          Regions defined by planes   Sketch the region defined by the inequalities .    Video solution     The region is all points between the planes and . These planes are sketched in Figure , which are parallel to the -plane. Thus the region extends infinitely in the and directions, and is bounded by planes in the direction.   Sketching the boundaries of a region in Example             Cylinders  The equation obviously lacks the and variables, meaning it defines points where the and coordinates can take on any value. Now consider the equation  in space. In the plane , this equation describes a circle of radius 1, centered at the origin. In space, the coordinate is not specified, meaning it can take on any value. In Figure , we show part of the graph of the equation by sketching 3 circles: the bottom one has a constant -value of , the middle one has a -value of 0 and the top circle has a -value of 1. By plotting all possible -values, we get the surface shown in Figure . This surface looks like a tube, or a cylinder ; mathematicians call this surface a cylinder for an entirely different reason.   Video introduction to     Sketching                        Cylinder   Let be a curve in a plane and let be a line not parallel to . A cylinder is the set of all lines parallel to that pass through . The curve is the directrix of the cylinder, and the lines are the rulings . cylinder  directrix     In this text, we consider curves that lie in planes parallel to one of the coordinate planes, and lines that are perpendicular to these planes, forming right cylinders . Thus the directrix can be defined using equations involving 2 variables, and the rulings will be parallel to the axis of the third variable.  In the example preceding the definition, the curve in the -plane is the directrix and the rulings are lines parallel to the -axis. (Any circle shown in Figure can be considered a directrix; we simply choose the one where .) Sample rulings can also be viewed in Figure . More examples will help us understand this definition.   Graphing cylinders   Graph the following cylinders.          Video solution        We can view the equation as a parabola in the -plane, as illustrated in Figure . As does not appear in the equation, the rulings are lines through this parabola parallel to the -axis, shown in Figure . These rulings give a general idea as to what the surface looks like, drawn in Figure .   Sketching the cylinder defined by                                  We can view the equation as a sine curve that exists in the -plane, as shown in Figure . The rules are parallel to the axis as the variable does not appear in the equation ; some of these are shown in Figure . The surface is shown in Figure .   Sketching the cylinder defined by                                       Surfaces of Revolution  One of the applications of integration we learned previously was to find the volume of solids of revolution solids formed by revolving a curve about a horizontal or vertical axis. We now consider how to find the equation of the surface of such a solid.   Video presentation of    Consider the surface formed by revolving about the -axis. Cross-sections of this surface parallel to the -plane are circles, as shown in Figure . Each circle has equation of the form for some radius . The radius is a function of ; in fact, it is . Thus the equation of the surface shown in Figure is .   Introducing surfaces of revolution                       We generalize the above principles to give the equations of surfaces formed by revolving curves about the coordinate axes.   Surfaces of Revolution, Part 1  Let be a radius function. surface of revolution    The equation of the surface formed by revolving or about the -axis is .    The equation of the surface formed by revolving or about the -axis is .    The equation of the surface formed by revolving or about the -axis is .       Finding equation of a surface of revolution   Let on . Find the equation of the surface of revolution formed by revolving about the -axis.    Video solution     Using Key Idea , we find the surface has equation . The curve is sketched in Figure and the surface is drawn in Figure .  Note how the surface (and hence the resulting equation) is the same if we began with the curve , which is also drawn in Figure .   Revolving about the -axis in Example                         This particular method of creating surfaces of revolution is limited. For instance, in Example of Section we found the volume of the solid formed by revolving about the -axis. Our current method of forming surfaces can only rotate about the -axis. Trying to rewrite as a function of is not trivial, as simply writing only gives part of the region we desire.  What we desire is a way of writing the surface of revolution formed by rotating about the -axis. We start by first recognizing this surface is the same as revolving about the -axis. This will give us a more natural way of viewing the surface.  A value of is a measurement of distance from the -axis. At the distance , we plot a -height of . When rotating about the -axis, we want all points a distance of from the -axis in the -plane to have a -height of . All such points satisfy the equation ; hence . Replacing with in gives . This is the equation of the surface.   Surfaces of Revolution, Part 2  Let , , be a curve in the -plane. The surface formed by revolving this curve about the -axis has equation . surface of revolution     Finding equation of surface of revolution   Find the equation of the surface found by revolving about the -axis.    Using Key Idea , the surface has equation . The curve and surface are graphed in Figure .   Revolving about the -axis in Example                           Quadric Surfaces  Spheres, planes and cylinders are important surfaces to understand. We now consider one last type of surface, a quadric surface . The definition may look intimidating, but we will show how to analyze these surfaces in an illuminating way.   Video introduction to     Quadric Surface   A quadric surface is the graph of the general second-degree equation in three variables: quadric surface definition  .    When the coefficients , or are not zero, the basic shapes of the quadric surfaces are rotated in space. We will focus on quadric surfaces where these coefficients are 0; we will not consider rotations. There are six basic quadric surfaces: the elliptic paraboloid, elliptic cone, ellipsoid, hyperboloid of one sheet, hyperboloid of two sheets, and the hyperbolic paraboloid.   The elliptic paraboloid         We study each shape by considering traces , trace  quadric surface trace that is, intersections of each surface with a plane parallel to a coordinate plane. For instance, consider the elliptic paraboloid , shown in Figure . If we intersect this shape with the plane ( , replace with ), we have the equation: .  This describes an ellipse so cross sections parallel to the -coordinate plane are ellipses. This ellipse is drawn in the figure.  Now consider cross sections parallel to the -plane. For instance, letting gives the equation , clearly a parabola. Intersecting with the plane gives a cross section defined by , another parabola. These parabolas are also sketched in the figure.  Thus we see where the elliptic paraboloid gets its name: some cross sections are ellipses, and others are parabolas.  Such an analysis can be made with each of the quadric surfaces. We give a sample equation of each, provide a sketch with representative traces, and describe these traces.     Elliptic Paraboloid                 Plane   Trace           Parabola      Parabola      Ellipse           One variable in the equation of the elliptic paraboloid will be raised to the first power; above, this is the variable. The paraboloid will open in the direction of this variable's axis. Thus is an elliptic paraboloid that opens along the -axis. Multiplying the right hand side by defines an elliptic paraboloid that opens in the opposite direction. quadric surface gallery  quadric surface elliptic paraboloid      Elliptic Cone                  Plane   Trace           Crossed Lines      Crossed Lines         Hyperbola      Hyperbola      Ellipse                    One can rewrite the equation as .

Video solution         : We first identify the quadric by pattern-matching with the equations given previously. Only two surfaces have equations where one variable is raised to the first power, the elliptic paraboloid and the hyperbolic paraboloid. In the latter case, the other variables have different signs, so we conclude that this describes a hyperbolic paraboloid. As the variable with the first power is , we note the paraboloid opens along the -axis. To make a decent sketch by hand, we need only draw a few traces. In this case, the traces and form parabolas that outline the shape.   : The trace is the parabola    : The trace is the parabola .  Graphing each trace in the respective plane creates a sketch as shown in Figure . This is enough to give an idea of what the paraboloid looks like. The surface is filled in in Figure .   Sketching an elliptic paraboloid                          This is an ellipsoid. We can get a good idea of its shape by drawing the traces in the coordinate planes.   : The trace is the ellipse .

Which of the following equations best fits this surface?           A possible equation of this quadric surface is found in Example           The image clearly displays a hyperboloid of two sheets. The gallery informs us that the equation will have a form similar to .  We can immediately eliminate option (a), as the constant in that equation is not 1.  The hyperboloid opens along the -axis, meaning must be the only variable with a positive coefficient, eliminating (c).  The hyperboloid is wider in the -direction than in the -direction, so we need an equation where . This eliminates (b), leaving us with (d). We should verify that the equation given in (d), , fits.  We already established that this equation describes a hyperboloid of two sheets that opens in the -direction and is wider in the -direction than in the . Now note the coefficient of the -term. Rewriting in standard form, we have: . Thus when and , must be ; , each hyperboloid starts at . This matches our figure.  We conclude that best fits the graph.

  "title": "An Introduction to Vectors",
  "body": " An Introduction to Vectors  Many quantities we think about daily can be described by a single number: temperature, speed, cost, weight and height. There are also many other concepts we encounter daily that cannot be described with just one number. For instance, a weather forecaster often describes wind with its speed and its direction ( with winds from the southeast gusting up to 30 mph ). When applying a force, we are concerned with both the magnitude and direction of that force. In both of these examples, direction is important. Because of this, we study vectors , mathematical objects that convey both magnitude and direction information.   Video introduction to    One bare-bones definition of a vector is based on what we wrote above: a vector is a mathematical object with magnitude and direction parameters. This definition leaves much to be desired, as it gives no indication as to how such an object is to be used. Several other definitions exist; we choose here a definition rooted in a geometric visualization of vectors. It is very simplistic but readily permits further investigation.   Vector   A vector is a directed line segment.  Given points and (either in the plane or in space), we denote with the vector from   to  . The point is said to be the initial point of the vector, and the point is the terminal point .  The magnitude , length or norm of is the length of the line segment : .  Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction. vectors  vectors definition  vectors norm  vectors magnitude  norm  magnitude of vector  terminal point  initial point      Figure shows multiple instances of the same vector. Each directed line segment has the same direction and length (magnitude), hence each is the same vector.   Drawing the same vector with different initial points         We use (pronounced r two ) to represent all the vectors in the plane, and use (pronounced r three ) to represent all the vectors in space. r@    Illustrating how equal vectors have the same displacement         Consider the vectors and as shown in Figure . The vectors look to be equal; that is, they seem to have the same length and direction. Indeed, they are. Both vectors move 2 units to the right and 1 unit up from the initial point to reach the terminal point. One can analyze this movement to measure the magnitude of the vector, and the movement itself gives direction information (one could also measure the slope of the line passing through and or and ). Since they have the same length and direction, these two vectors are equal.  This demonstrates that inherently all we care about is displacement ; that is, how far in the , and possibly directions the terminal point is from the initial point. Both the vectors and in Figure have an -displacement of 2 and a -displacement of 1. This suggests a standard way of describing vectors in the plane. A vector whose -displacement is and whose -displacement is will have terminal point when the initial point is the origin, . This leads us to a definition of a standard and concise way of referring to vectors.   Component Form of a Vector      The component form of a vector in , whose terminal point is when its initial point is , is .    The component form of a vector in , whose terminal point is when its initial point is , is .     The numbers , (and , respectively) are the components of . vectors component form     It follows from the definition that the component form of the vector , where and is in space, where and , the component form of is .  We practice using this notation in the following example.   Using component form notation for vectors      Sketch the vector starting at and find its magnitude.    Find the component form of the vector whose initial point is and whose terminal point is .    Sketch the vector starting at the point and find its magnitude.       Video solution        Using as the initial point, we move 2 units in the positive -direction and units in the positive -direction to arrive at the terminal point , as drawn in Figure . The magnitude of is determined directly from the component form: .   Graphing vectors in Example                         Using the note following Definition , we have . One can readily see from Figure that the - and -displacement of is 2 and 4, respectively, as the component form suggests.    Using as the initial point, we move 2 units in the positive -direction, unit in the positive -direction, and 3 units in the positive -direction to arrive at the terminal point , illustrated in Figure . The magnitude of is: .       Now that we have defined vectors, and have created a nice notation by which to describe them, we start considering how vectors interact with each other. That is, we define an algebra on vectors.   Vector Algebra      Let and be vectors in , and let be a scalar. vectors algebra of      The addition, or sum, of the vectors and is the vector .    The scalar product of and is the vector .       Let and be vectors in , and let be a scalar.     The addition, or sum, of the vectors and is the vector .    The scalar product of and is the vector .          In short, we say addition and scalar multiplication are computed component-wise.    Video presentation of (2 videos)     Adding vectors   Sketch the vectors , and all with initial point at the origin.    Video solution     We first compute . .   Graphing the sum of vectors in Example         These are all sketched in Figure .    As vectors convey magnitude and direction information, the sum of vectors also convey length and magnitude information. Adding suggests the following idea:    Starting at an initial point, go out , then go out .    This idea is sketched in Figure , where the initial point of is the terminal point of . This is known as the Head to Tail Rule of adding vectors. Vector addition is very important. For instance, if the vectors and represent forces acting on a body, the sum gives the resulting force. Because of various physical applications of vector addition, the sum is often referred to as the resultant vector , or just the resultant.  vectors resultant  Parallelogram Law  vectors Parallelogram Law  Head To Tail Rule  vectors Head To Tail Rule  vectors zero vector    Illustrating how to add vectors using the Head to Tail Rule and Parallelogram Law         Analytically, it is easy to see that . Figure also gives a graphical representation of this, using gray vectors. Note that the vectors and , when arranged as in the figure, form a parallelogram. Because of this, the Head to Tail Rule is also known as the Parallelogram Law: the vector is defined by forming the parallelogram defined by the vectors and ; the initial point of is the common initial point of parallelogram, and the terminal point of the sum is the common terminal point of the parallelogram.  While not illustrated here, the Head to Tail Rule and Parallelogram Law hold for vectors in as well.  It follows from the properties of the real numbers and Definition that .  The Parallelogram Law gives us a good way to visualize this subtraction. We demonstrate this in the following example.   Vector Subtraction   Let and . Compute and sketch .    Video solution     The computation of is straightforward, and we show all steps below. Usually the formal step of multiplying by is omitted and we just subtract.  .   Illustrating how to subtract vectors graphically          Figure illustrates, using the Head to Tail Rule, how the subtraction can be viewed as the sum . The figure also illustrates how can be obtained by looking only at the terminal points of and (when their initial points are the same).     Scaling vectors      Sketch the vectors and with initial point at the origin.    Compute the magnitudes of and .       Video solution        We compute : .   Graphing vectors and in Example         Both and are sketched in Figure . Make note that does not start at the terminal point of ; rather, its initial point is also the origin.    The figure suggests that is twice as long as . We compute their magnitudes to confirm this. . As we suspected, is twice as long as .       The zero vector is the vector whose initial point is also its terminal point. It is denoted by . Its component form, in , is ; in , it is . Usually the context makes is clear whether is referring to a vector in the plane or in space.  Our examples have illustrated key principles in vector algebra: how to add and subtract vectors and how to multiply vectors by a scalar. The following theorem states formally the properties of these operations.   Properties of Vector Operations   The following are true for all scalars and , and for all vectors , and , where , and are all in or where , and are all in : vectors algebraic properties       Commutative Property     Associative Property     Additive Identity          Distributive Property     Distributive Property               if, and only if, .        Video presentation of Part of    As stated before, each nonzero vector conveys magnitude and direction information. We have a method of extracting the magnitude, which we write as . Unit vectors are a way of extracting just the direction information from a vector.   Unit Vector   A unit vector is a vector with a magnitude of 1; that is, vectors unit vector  unit vector  .     Video presentation of    Consider this scenario: you are given a vector and are told to create a vector of length 10 in the direction of . How does one do that? If we knew that was the unit vector in the direction of , the answer would be easy: . So how do we find ?   Property of Theorem holds the key. If we divide by its magnitude, it becomes a vector of length 1. Consider: .  So the vector of length 10 in the direction of is . An example will make this more clear.   Using Unit Vectors   Let and let .     Find the unit vector in the direction of .    Find the unit vector in the direction of .    Find the vector in the direction of with magnitude 5.       Video solution        We find . So the unit vector in the direction of is .    We find , so the unit vector in the direction of is .    To create a vector with magnitude 5 in the direction of , we multiply the unit vector by 5. Thus is the vector we seek. This is sketched in Figure .   Graphing vectors in Example . All vectors shown have their initial point at the origin              The basic formation of the unit vector in the direction of a vector leads to a interesting equation. It is: .  We rewrite the equation with parentheses to make a point: .  This equation illustrates the fact that a nonzero vector has both magnitude and direction, where we view a unit vector as supplying only direction information. Identifying unit vectors with direction allows us to define parallel vectors .   Parallel Vectors      Unit vectors and are parallel if . vectors parallel  parallel vectors     Nonzero vectors and are parallel if their respective unit vectors are parallel.        Video presentation of    It is equivalent to say that vectors and are parallel if there is a scalar such that (see marginal note).   Direction and the zero vector   is directionless; because , there is no unit vector in the direction of .  Some texts define two vectors as being parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. By this definition, is parallel to all vectors as for all .  We define what it means for two vectors to be perpendicular in Definition , which is written to exclude . It could be written to include ; by such a definition, is perpendicular to all vectors. While counter-intuitive, it is mathematically sound to allow to be both parallel and perpendicular to all vectors.  We prefer the given definition of parallel as it is grounded in the fact that unit vectors provide direction information. One may adopt the convention that is parallel to all vectors if they desire. (See also the aside in Section .)   If one graphed all unit vectors in with the initial point at the origin, then the terminal points would all lie on the unit circle. Based on what we know from trigonometry, we can then say that the component form of all unit vectors in is for some angle .  A similar construction in shows that the terminal points all lie on the unit sphere. These vectors also have a particular component form, but its derivation is not as straightforward as the one for unit vectors in . Important concepts about unit vectors are given in the following Key Idea.   Unit Vectors     The unit vector in the direction of a nonzero vector is .    A vector in is a unit vector if, and only if, its component form is for some angle . unit vector properties  vectors unit vector     A vector in is a unit vector if, and only if, its component form is for some angles and .      These formulas can come in handy in a variety of situations, especially the formula for unit vectors in the plane.   Finding Component Forces   Consider a weight of 50lb hanging from two chains, as shown in Figure . One chain makes an angle of with the vertical, and the other an angle of . Find the force applied to each chain.   A diagram of a weight hanging from 2 chains in Example           Video solution     Knowing that gravity is pulling the 50lb weight straight down, we can create a vector to represent this force. .  We can view each chain as pulling the weight up, preventing it from falling. We can represent the force from each chain with a vector. Let represent the force from the chain making an angle of with the vertical, and let represent the force form the other chain. Convert all angles to be measured from the horizontal (as shown in Figure ), and apply Key Idea . As we do not yet know the magnitudes of these vectors, (that is the problem at hand), we use and to represent them.    As the weight is not moving, we know the sum of the forces is . This gives:    A diagram of the force vectors from Example         The sum of the entries in the first component is 0, and the sum of the entries in the second component is also 0. This leads us to the following two equations:   This is a simple 2-equation, 2-unknown system of linear equations. We leave it to the reader to verify that the solution is .  It might seem odd that the sum of the forces applied to the chains is more than 50lb. We leave it to a physics class to discuss the full details, but offer this short explanation. Our equations were established so that the vertical components of each force sums to 50lb, thus supporting the weight. Since the chains are at an angle, they also pull against each other, creating an additional horizontal force while holding the weight in place.    Unit vectors were very important in the previous calculation; they allowed us to define a vector in the proper direction but with an unknown magnitude. Our computations were then computed component-wise. Because such calculations are often necessary, the standard unit vectors can be useful.   Standard Unit Vectors      In , the standard unit vectors are vectors standard unit vector unit vector standard unit vector  .    In , the standard unit vectors are .        Using standard unit vectors      Rewrite using the standard unit vectors.    Rewrite in component form.                     These two examples demonstrate that converting between component form and the standard unit vectors is rather straightforward. Many mathematicians prefer component form, and it is the preferred notation in this text. Many engineers prefer using the standard unit vectors, and many engineering text use that notation.     Finding Component Force   A weight of 25lb is suspended from a chain of length 2ft while a wind pushes the weight to the right with constant force of 5lb as shown in Figure . What angle will the chain make with the vertical as a result of the wind's pushing? How much higher will the weight be?   A figure of a weight being pushed by the wind in Example           The force of the wind is represented by the vector . The force of gravity on the weight is represented by . The direction and magnitude of the vector representing the force on the chain are both unknown. We represent this force with for some magnitude and some angle with the horizontal . (Note: is the angle the chain makes with the vertical ; is the angle with the horizontal .)  As the weight is at equilibrium, the sum of the forces is :   Thus the sum of the and components are 0, leading us to the following system of equations:   This is enough to determine already, as we know and . Thus . We can use this to find the magnitude : .  We can then use either equality from Equation to solve for . We choose the first equality as using arccosine will return an angle in the nd quadrant: .  Subtracting from this angle gives us an angle of with the vertical.  We can now use trigonometry to find out how high the weight is lifted. The diagram shows that a right triangle is formed with the 2ft chain as the hypotenuse with an interior angle of . The length of the adjacent side (in the diagram, the dashed vertical line) is ft. Thus the weight is lifted by about ft, almost 1\/2in.    The algebra we have applied to vectors is already demonstrating itself to be very useful. There are two more fundamental operations we can perform with vectors, the dot product and the cross product . The next two sections explore each in turn.

A diagram of a weight hanging from 2 chains in Example           Video solution     Knowing that gravity is pulling the 50lb weight straight down, we can create a vector to represent this force. .  We can view each chain as pulling the weight up, preventing it from falling. We can represent the force from each chain with a vector. Let represent the force from the chain making an angle of with the vertical, and let represent the force form the other chain. Convert all angles to be measured from the horizontal (as shown in Figure ), and apply Key Idea . As we do not yet know the magnitudes of these vectors, (that is the problem at hand), we use and to represent them.    As the weight is not moving, we know the sum of the forces is . This gives:    A diagram of the force vectors from Example         The sum of the entries in the first component is 0, and the sum of the entries in the second component is also 0. This leads us to the following two equations:   This is a simple 2-equation, 2-unknown system of linear equations. We leave it to the reader to verify that the solution is .  It might seem odd that the sum of the forces applied to the chains is more than 50lb. We leave it to a physics class to discuss the full details, but offer this short explanation. Our equations were established so that the vertical components of each force sums to 50lb, thus supporting the weight. Since the chains are at an angle, they also pull against each other, creating an additional horizontal force while holding the weight in place.   "

A figure of a weight being pushed by the wind in Example           The force of the wind is represented by the vector . The force of gravity on the weight is represented by . The direction and magnitude of the vector representing the force on the chain are both unknown. We represent this force with for some magnitude and some angle with the horizontal . (Note: is the angle the chain makes with the vertical ; is the angle with the horizontal .)  As the weight is at equilibrium, the sum of the forces is :   Thus the sum of the and components are 0, leading us to the following system of equations:   This is enough to determine already, as we know and . Thus . We can use this to find the magnitude : .  We can then use either equality from Equation to solve for . We choose the first equality as using arccosine will return an angle in the nd quadrant: .  Subtracting from this angle gives us an angle of with the vertical.  We can now use trigonometry to find out how high the weight is lifted. The diagram shows that a right triangle is formed with the 2ft chain as the hypotenuse with an interior angle of . The length of the adjacent side (in the diagram, the dashed vertical line) is ft. Thus the weight is lifted by about ft, almost 1\/2in.   "

  "body": " The Dot Product   The previous section introduced vectors and described how to add them together and how to multiply them by scalars. This section introduces a multiplication on vectors called the dot product .   Video introduction to     Dot Product      Let and in . The dot product of and , denoted , is .    Let and in . The dot product of and , denoted , is .    dot product definition  vectors dot product     Note how this product of vectors returns a scalar , not another vector. We practice evaluating a dot product in the following example, then we will discuss why this product is useful.   Evaluating dot products      Let , in . Find .    Let and in . Find .       Video solution        Using Definition , we have .    Using the definition, we have .       The dot product, as shown by the preceding example, is very simple to evaluate. It is only the sum of products. While the definition gives no hint as to why we would care about this operation, there is an amazing connection between the dot product and angles formed by the vectors. Before stating this connection, we give a theorem stating some of the properties of the dot product.   Properties of the Dot Product   Let , and be vectors in or and let be a scalar. dot product properties  vectors dot product       {Commutative Property}     {Distributive Property}                      The last statement of the theorem makes a handy connection between the magnitude of a vector and the dot product with itself. Our definition and theorem give properties of the dot product, but we are still likely wondering What does the dot product mean ? It is helpful to understand that the dot product of a vector with itself is connected to its magnitude.   Video presentation of    The next theorem extends this understanding by connecting the dot product to magnitudes and angles. Given vectors and in the plane, an angle is clearly formed when and are drawn with the same initial point as illustrated in Figure . (We always take to be the angle in as two angles are actually created.)   Illustrating the angle formed by two vectors with the same initial point                       The same is also true of 2 vectors in space: given and in with the same initial point, there is a plane that contains both and . (When and are co-linear, there are infinitely many planes that contain both vectors.) In that plane, we can again find an angle between them (and again, ). This is illustrated in Figure .  The following theorem connects this angle to the dot product of and .   The Dot Product and Angles   Let and be nonzero vectors in or . Then , where , , is the angle between and . dot product properties  vectors dot product      Video presentation of    Using Theorem , we can rewrite this theorem as .  Note how on the left hand side of the equation, we are computing the dot product of two unit vectors. Recalling that unit vectors essentially only provide direction information, we can informally restate Theorem as saying The dot product of two directions gives the cosine of the angle between them.   When is an acute angle ( , ), is positive; when , ; when is an obtuse angle ( ), is negative. Thus the sign of the dot product gives a general indication of the angle between the vectors, illustrated in Figure .   Illustrating the relationship between the angle between vectors and the sign of their dot product         We can use Theorem to compute the dot product, but generally this theorem is used to find the angle between known vectors (since the dot product is generally easy to compute). To this end, we rewrite the theorem's equation as .  We practice using this theorem in the following example.   Using the dot product to find angles   Let , and , as shown in Figure . Find the angles , and .   Vectors used in Example           Video solution     We start by computing the magnitude of each vector. .  We now apply Theorem to find the angles. .     We see from our computation that , as indicated by Figure . While we knew this should be the case, it is nice to see that this non-intuitive formula indeed returns the results we expected.  We do a similar example next in the context of vectors in space.   Using the dot product to find angles   Let , and , as illustrated in Figure . Find the angle between each pair of vectors.   Vectors used in Example              Between and : .    Between and : .    Between and : .     While our work shows that each angle is , , , none of these angles looks to be a right angle in Figure . Such is the case when drawing three-dimensional objects on the page.    All three angles between these vectors was , or . We know from geometry and everyday life that angles are nice for a variety of reasons, so it should seem significant that these angles are all . Notice the common feature in each calculation (and also the calculation of in Example ): the dot products of each pair of angles was 0. We use this as a basis for a definition of the term orthogonal , which is essentially synonymous to perpendicular .   Orthogonal   Nonzero vectors and are orthogonal if their dot product is 0. orthogonal  perpendicular|see{orthogonal}  vectors orthogonal      The term perpendicular originally referred to lines. As mathematics progressed, the concept of being at right angles to was applied to other objects, such as vectors and planes, and the term orthogonal was introduced. It is especially used when discussing objects that are hard, or impossible, to visualize: two vectors in 5-dimensional space are orthogonal if their dot product is 0. It is not wrong to say they are perpendicular , but common convention gives preference to the word orthogonal .    Finding orthogonal vectors   Let and .     Find two vectors in that are orthogonal to .    Find two non-parallel vectors in that are orthogonal to .       Video solution        Recall that a line perpendicular to a line with slope has slope , the opposite reciprocal slope. We can think of the slope of as , its rise over run. A vector orthogonal to will have slope . There are many such choices, though all parallel:     There are infinitely many directions in space orthogonal to any given direction, so there are an infinite number of non-parallel vectors orthogonal to . Since there are so many, we have great leeway in finding some. One way is to arbitrarily pick values for the first two components, leaving the third unknown. For instance, let . If is to be orthogonal to , then , so . So is orthogonal to . We can apply a similar technique by leaving the first or second component unknown. Another method of finding a vector orthogonal to mirrors what we did in part 1. Let . Here we switched the first two components of , changing the sign of one of them (similar to the opposite reciprocal concept before). Letting the third component be 0 effectively ignores the third component of , and it is easy to see that . Clearly and are not parallel.       An important construction is illustrated in Figure , where vectors and are sketched. In Figure , a dotted line is drawn from the tip of to the line containing , where the dotted line is orthogonal to . In Figure , the dotted line is replaced with the vector and is formed, parallel to . It is clear by the diagram that . What is important about this construction is this: is decomposed as the sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to and one that is perpendicular to . It is hard to overstate the importance of this construction (as we'll see in upcoming examples).  The vectors , and as shown in Figure form a right triangle, where the angle between and is labeled . We can find in terms of and .  Using trigonometry, we can state that .   Developing the construction of the orthogonal projection                       We also know that is parallel to to ; that is, the direction of is the direction of , described by the unit vector . The vector is the vector in the direction with magnitude : .  Since this construction is so important, it is given a special name.   Orthogonal Projection   Let nonzero vectors and be given. The orthogonal projection of onto , denoted , is orthogonal projection  vectors orthogonal projection  .     Video presentation of     Computing the orthogonal projection      Let and . Find , and sketch all three vectors with initial points at the origin.    Let and . Find , and sketch all three vectors with initial points at the origin.       Video solution        Applying Definition , we have . Vectors , and are sketched in Figure . Note how the projection is parallel to ; that is, it lies on the same line through the origin as , although it points in the opposite direction. That is because the angle between and is obtuse ( , greater than ).   Sketching the three vectors in Part of Example         Apply the definition: . These vectors are sketched in Figure , and again in Figure from a different perspective. Because of the nature of graphing these vectors, the sketch in Figure makes it difficult to recognize that the drawn projection has the geometric properties it should. The graph shown in Figure illustrates these properties better.   Sketching the three vectors in Part of Example                           We can use the properties of the dot product found in Theorem to rearrange the formula found in Definition : .  The above formula shows that the orthogonal projection of onto is only concerned with the direction of , as both instances of in the formula come in the form , the unit vector in the direction of .  A special case of orthogonal projection occurs when is a unit vector. In this situation, the formula for the orthogonal projection of a vector onto reduces to just , as .  This gives us a new understanding of the dot product. When is a unit vector, essentially providing only direction information, the dot product of and gives how much of is in the direction of . This use of the dot product will be very useful in future sections.   Illustrating the orthogonal projection         Now consider Figure where the concept of the orthogonal projection is again illustrated. It is clear that .  As we know what and are, we can solve for and state that .  This leads us to rewrite Equation in a seemingly silly way: .  This is not nonsense, as pointed out in the following Key Idea. (Notation note: the expression  means is parallel to . We can use this notation to state  which means is parallel to . The expression  means is orthogonal to , and is used similarly.)   Orthogonal Decomposition of Vectors  Let nonzero vectors and be given. Then can be written as the sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to , and one of which is orthogonal to : orthogonal decomposition of vectors  orthogonal decomposition  vectors orthogonal decomposition  .   We illustrate the use of this equality in the following example.   Orthogonal decomposition of vectors      Let and as in Example . Decompose as the sum of a vector parallel to and a vector orthogonal to .    Let and as in Example . Decompose as the sum of a vector parallel to and a vector orthogonal to .       Video solution        In Example , we found that . Let . Is orthogonal to ? ( , is ?) We check for orthogonality with the dot product: . Since the dot product is 0, we know . Thus: .    We found in Example that . Applying the Key Idea, we have: . We check to see if : . Since the dot product is 0, we know the two vectors are orthogonal. We now write as the sum of two vectors, one parallel and one orthogonal to :        We give an example of where this decomposition is useful.   Orthogonally decomposing a force vector   Consider Figure , showing a box weighing 50lb on a ramp that rises 5ft over a span of 20ft. Find the components of force, and their magnitudes, acting on the box (as sketched in Figure ):   Sketching the ramp and box in Example . Note: The vectors are not drawn to scale.                          in the direction of the ramp, and    orthogonal to the ramp.       Video solution     As the ramp rises 5ft over a horizontal distance of 20ft, we can represent the direction of the ramp with the vector . Gravity pulls down with a force of 50lb, which we represent with .     To find the force of gravity in the direction of the ramp, we compute : . The magnitude of is . Though the box weighs 50lb, a force of about 12lb is enough to keep the box from sliding down the ramp.    To find the component of gravity orthogonal to the ramp, we use Key Idea . . The magnitude of this force is lb. In physics and engineering, knowing this force is important when computing things like static frictional force. (For instance, we could easily compute if the static frictional force alone was enough to keep the box from sliding down the ramp.)         Application to Work  In physics, the application of a force to move an object in a straight line a distance produces work ; the amount of work is , (where is in the direction of travel). The orthogonal projection allows us to compute work when the force is not in the direction of travel.   Finding work when the force and direction of travel are given as vectors         Consider Figure , where a force is being applied to an object moving in the direction of . (The distance the object travels is the magnitude of .) The work done is the amount of force in the direction of , , times : .  The expression will be positive if the angle between and is acute; when the angle is obtuse (hence is negative), the force is causing motion in the opposite direction of , resulting in negative work. We want to capture this sign, so we drop the absolute value and find that .   Work   Let be a constant force that moves an object in a straight line from point to point . Let . The work  done by along is . work      Computing work   A man slides a box along a ramp that rises 3ft over a distance of 15ft by applying 50lb of force as shown in Figure . Compute the work done.   Computing work when sliding a box up a ramp in Example           The figure indicates that the force applied makes a angle with the horizontal, so . The ramp is represented by . The work done is simply .  Note how we did not actually compute the distance the object traveled, nor the magnitude of the force in the direction of travel; this is all inherently computed by the dot product!    The dot product is a powerful way of evaluating computations that depend on angles without actually using angles. The next section explores another product on vectors, the cross product. Once again, angles play an important role, though in a much different way.     Terms and Concepts   The dot product of two vectors is a , not a vector.   Scalar    How are the concepts of the dot product and vector magnitude related?   The magnitude of a vectors is the square root of the dot product of a vector with itself; that is, .    How can one quickly tell if the angle between two vectors is acute or obtuse?   By considering the sign of the dot product of the two vectors. If the dot product is positive, the angle is acute; if the dot product is negative, the angle is obtuse.    Give a synonym for orthogonal.     Perpendicular is one answer.     Problems    In the following exercises, find the dot product of the given vectors.                                                                 ,    not defined                    Create your own vectors , and in and show that .

A vector orthogonal to will have slope . There are many such choices, though all parallel:     There are infinitely many directions in space orthogonal to any given direction, so there are an infinite number of non-parallel vectors orthogonal to . Since there are so many, we have great leeway in finding some. One way is to arbitrarily pick values for the first two components, leaving the third unknown. For instance, let . If is to be orthogonal to , then , so . So is orthogonal to . We can apply a similar technique by leaving the first or second component unknown. Another method of finding a vector orthogonal to mirrors what we did in part 1. Let . Here we switched the first two components of , changing the sign of one of them (similar to the opposite reciprocal concept before). Letting the third component be 0 effectively ignores the third component of , and it is easy to see that . Clearly and are not parallel.      "

  "body": " The Cross Product    Orthogonality is immensely important. A quick scan of your current environment will undoubtedly reveal numerous surfaces and edges that are perpendicular to each other (including the edges of this page). The dot product provides a quick test for orthogonality: vectors and are perpendicular if, and only if, .   Video introduction to    Given two non-parallel, nonzero vectors and in space, it is very useful to find a vector that is perpendicular to both and . There is an operation, called the cross product , that creates such a vector. This section defines the cross product, then explores its properties and applications.   Cross Product   Let and be vectors in . The cross product of and , denoted , is the vector vectors cross product cross product definition  .    This definition can be a bit cumbersome to remember. After an example we will give a convenient method for computing the cross product. For now, careful examination of the products and differences given in the definition should reveal a pattern that is not too difficult to remember. (For instance, in the first component only 2 and 3 appear as subscripts; in the second component, only 1 and 3 appear as subscripts. Further study reveals the order in which they appear.)  Let's practice using this definition by computing a cross product.   Computing a cross product   Let and . Find , and verify that it is orthogonal to both and .    Video solution     Using Definition , we have .  (We encourage the reader to compute this product on their own, then verify their result.)  We test whether or not is orthogonal to and using the dot product: , .  Since both dot products are zero, is indeed orthogonal to both and .    A convenient method of computing the cross product starts with forming a particular  matrix , or rectangular array. The first row comprises the standard unit vectors , , and . The second and third rows are the vectors and , respectively. Using and from Example , we begin with:   Now repeat the first two columns after the original three: This gives three full upper left to lower right diagonals, and three full upper right to lower left diagonals, as shown. Compute the products along each diagonal, then add the products on the right and subtract the products on the left:       .   Video presentation of the determinant formula for the cross product    We practice using this method.   Computing a cross product   Let and . Compute both and .    Video solution     To compute , we form the matrix as prescribed above, complete with repeated first columns:   We let the reader compute the products of the diagonals; we give the result: .  To compute , we switch the second and third rows of the above matrix, then multiply along diagonals and subtract:   Note how with the rows being switched, the products that once appeared on the right now appear on the left, and vice-versa. Thus the result is: , which is the opposite of . We leave it to the reader to verify that each of these vectors is orthogonal to and .      Properties of the Cross Product  It is not coincidence that in the preceding example; one can show using Definition that this will always be the case. The following theorem states several useful properties of the cross product, each of which can be verified by referring to the definition.   Properties of the Cross Product   Let , and be vectors in and let be a scalar. The following identities hold: vectors cross product  cross product properties       Anticommutative Property        Distributive Properties                     Orthogonality Properties                       Triple Scalar Product        Video presentation of    We introduced the cross product as a way to find a vector orthogonal to two given vectors, but we did not give a proof that the construction given in Definition satisfies this property. Theorem asserts this property holds; we leave it as a problem in the Exercise section to verify this.  Property 5 from the theorem is also left to the reader to prove in the Exercise section, but it reveals something more interesting than the cross product of a vector with itself is . Let and be parallel vectors; that is, let there be a scalar such that . Consider their cross product: .  We have just shown that the cross product of parallel vectors is . This hints at something deeper. Theorem related the angle between two vectors and their dot product; there is a similar relationship relating the cross product of two vectors and the angle between them, given by the following theorem.   The Cross Product and Angles   Let and be nonzero vectors in . Then , where , , is the angle between and . vectors cross product  cross product properties      Parallel vectors and the cross product  We could rewrite Definition and Theorem to include , then define that and are parallel if . Since and , this would mean that is both parallel and orthogonal to all vectors. Apparent paradoxes such as this are not uncommon in mathematics and can be very useful. (See also the aside in Section .)   Note that this theorem makes a statement about the magnitude of the cross product. When the angle between and is 0 or ( , the vectors are parallel), the magnitude of the cross product is 0. The only vector with a magnitude of 0 is (see Property of Theorem ), hence the cross product of parallel vectors is .   Video presentation of and    We demonstrate the truth of this theorem in the following example.   The cross product and angles   Let and as in Example . Verify Theorem by finding , the angle between and , and the magnitude of .    We use Theorem to find the angle between and . .  Our work in Example showed that , hence . Is ? Using numerical approximations, we find: .  Numerically, they seem equal. Using a right triangle, one can show that , which allows us to verify the theorem exactly.     Right Hand Rule  The anticommutative property of the cross product demonstrates that and differ only by a sign these vectors have the same magnitude but point in the opposite direction. When seeking a vector perpendicular to and , we essentially have two directions to choose from, one in the direction of and one in the direction of . Does it matter which we choose? How can we tell which one we will get without graphing, etc.?  Another wonderful property of the cross product, as defined, is that it follows the right hand rule. Given and in with the same initial point, point the index finger of your right hand in the direction of and let your middle finger point in the direction of (much as we did when establishing the right hand rule for the 3-dimensional coordinate system). Your thumb will naturally extend in the direction of . One can practice this using Figure . If you switch, and point the index finder in the direction of and the middle finger in the direction of , your thumb will now point in the opposite direction, allowing you to visualize the anticommutative property of the cross product. right hand rule of the cross product    Illustrating the Right Hand Rule of the cross product            Applications of the Cross Product  There are a number of ways in which the cross product is useful in mathematics, physics and other areas of science beyond just finding a vector perpendicular to two others. We highlight a few here. cross product applications    Area of a Parallelogram  It is a standard geometry fact that the area of a parallelogram is , where is the length of the base and is the height of the parallelogram, as illustrated in Figure . As shown when defining the Parallelogram Law of vector addition, two vectors and define a parallelogram when drawn from the same initial point, as illustrated in Figure . Trigonometry tells us that , hence the area of the parallelogram is , where the second equality comes from Theorem .   Using the cross product to find the area of a parallelogram                       We illustrate using Equation in the following example. cross product applications!area of parallelogram    Finding the area of a parallelogram      Find the area of the parallelogram defined by the vectors and .    Verify that the points , , and are the vertices of a parallelogram. Find the area of the parallelogram.       Video solution         Figure sketches the parallelogram defined by the vectors and . We have a slight problem in that our vectors exist in , not , and the cross product is only defined on vectors in . We skirt this issue by viewing and as vectors in the plane of , and rewrite them as and . We can now compute the cross product. It is easy to show that ; therefore the area of the parallelogram is .   Sketching the parallelograms in Example                         To show that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram (shown in Figure ), we need to show that the opposite sides are parallel. We can quickly show that and . We find the area by computing the magnitude of the cross product of and : .       This application is perhaps more useful in finding the area of a triangle (in short, triangles are used more often than parallelograms). We illustrate this in the following example.   Area of a triangle   Find the area of the triangle with vertices , and , as pictured in Figure .   Finding the area of a triangle in Example           Video solution     We found the area of this triangle in Example to be using integration. There we discussed the fact that finding the area of a triangle can be inconvenient using the formula as one has to compute the height, which generally involves finding angles, etc. Using a cross product is much more direct.  We can choose any two sides of the triangle to use to form vectors; we choose and . As in the previous example, we will rewrite these vectors with a third component of 0 so that we can apply the cross product. The area of the triangle is .  We arrive at the same answer as before with less work.      Volume of a Parallelepiped  The three dimensional analogue to the parallelogram is the parallelepiped . Each face is parallel to the opposite face, as illustrated in Figure . By crossing and , one gets a vector whose magnitude is the area of the base. Dotting this vector with computes the volume of parallelepiped! (Up to a sign; take the absolute value.)   The word parallelepiped is pronounced parallel-eh-pipe-ed.     A parallelepiped is the three dimensional analogue to the parallelogram          cross product applications!volume of parallelepiped   Thus the volume of a parallelepiped defined by vectors , and is .  Note how this is the Triple Scalar Product, first seen in Theorem . Applying the identities given in the theorem shows that we can apply the Triple Scalar Product in any order we choose to find the volume. That is,    Finding the volume of parallelepiped   Find the volume of the parallelepiped defined by the vectors , and .    Video solution     We apply Equation . We first find . Then .  So the volume of the parallelepiped is 2 cubic units.   A parallelepiped in Example            While this application of the Triple Scalar Product is interesting, it is not used all that often: parallelepipeds are not a common shape in physics and engineering. The last application of the cross product is very applicable in engineering.   Torque   Torque is a measure of the turning force applied to an object. A classic scenario involving torque is the application of a wrench to a bolt. When a force is applied to the wrench, the bolt turns. When we represent the force and wrench with vectors and , we see that the bolt moves (because of the threads) in a direction orthogonal to and . Torque is usually represented by the Greek letter , or tau, and has units of N m, a Newton meter, or ft lb, a foot pound. cross product applications!torque  torque   While a full understanding of torque is beyond the purposes of this book, when a force is applied to a lever arm , the resulting torque is .   Computing torque   A lever of length 2ft makes an angle with the horizontal of . Find the resulting torque when a force of 10lb is applied to the end of the level where:   Showing a force being applied to a lever in Example            the force is perpendicular to the lever, and    the force makes an angle of with the lever, as shown in Figure .          We start by determining vectors for the force and lever arm. Since the lever arm makes a angle with the horizontal and is 2ft long, we can state that . Since the force vector is perpendicular to the lever arm (as seen in the left hand side of Figure ), we can conclude it is making an angle of with the horizontal. As it has a magnitude of 10lb, we can state . Using Equation to find the torque requires a cross product. We again let the third component of each vector be 0 and compute the cross product: This clearly has a magnitude of 20 ft-lb. We can view the force and lever arm vectors as lying on the page ; our computation of shows that the torque goes into the page. This follows the Right Hand Rule of the cross product, and it also matches well with the example of the wrench turning the bolt. Turning a bolt clockwise moves it in.    Our lever arm can still be represented by . As our force vector makes a angle with , we can see (referencing the right hand side of the figure) that makes a angle with the horizontal. Thus . We again make the third component 0 and take the cross product to find the torque: . As one might expect, when the force and lever arm vectors are orthogonal, the magnitude of force is greater than when the vectors are not orthogonal.        While the cross product has a variety of applications (as noted in this chapter), its fundamental use is finding a vector perpendicular to two others. Knowing a vector is orthogonal to two others is of incredible importance, as it allows us to find the equations of lines and planes in a variety of contexts. The importance of the cross product, in some sense, relies on the importance of lines and planes, which see widespread use throughout engineering, physics and mathematics. We study lines and planes in the next two sections.     Terms and Concepts   The cross product of two vectors is a , not a scalar.   vector    One can visualize the direction of using the     .   right hand rule    Give a synonym for orthogonal.

  "body": " Lines    lines To find the equation of a line in the -plane, we need two pieces of information: a point and the slope. The slope conveys direction information. As vertical lines have an undefined slope, the following statement is more accurate:  To define a line, one needs a point on the line and the direction of the line.  This holds true for lines in space.   Video introduction to      Lines in space  Let be a point in space, let be the vector with initial point at the origin and terminal point at ( ,  points to ), and let be a vector. Consider the points on the line through in the direction of .  Clearly one point on the line is ; we can say that the vector  lies at this point on the line. To find another point on the line, we can start at and move in a direction parallel to . For instance, starting at and traveling one length of places one at another point on the line. Consider Figure where certain points along the line are indicated.   Defining a line in space         The figure illustrates how every point on the line can be obtained by starting with and moving a certain distance in the direction of . That is, we can define the line as a function of : .  In many ways, this is not a new concept. Compare Equation to the familiar equation of a line:   Understanding the vector equation of a line       The equations exhibit the same structure: they give a starting point, define a direction, and state how far in that direction to travel.  Equation is an example of a vector-valued function ; the input of the function is a real number and the output is a vector. We will cover vector-valued functions extensively in the next chapter.  There are other ways to represent a line. Let and let . Then the equation of the line through in the direction of is: .  The last line states that the values of the line are given by , the values are given by , and the values are given by . These three equations, taken together, are the parametric equations of the line through in the direction of .  Finally, each of the equations for , and above contain the variable . We can solve for in each equation: , assuming . Since is equal to each expression on the right, we can set these equal to each other, forming the symmetric equations of the line through in the direction of : .  Each representation has its own advantages, depending on the context. We summarize these three forms in the following definition, then give examples of their use.   Equations of Lines in Space   Consider the line in space that passes through in the direction of . lines equations for      The vector equation of the line is .    The parametric equations of the line are .    The symmetric equations of the line are .        Finding the equation of a line   Give all three equations, as given in Definition , of the line through in the direction of . Does the point lie on this line?    Video solution     We identify the point with the vector . Following the definition, we have     the vector equation of the line is ;    the parametric equations of the line are     the symmetric equations of the line are .      Graphing a line in Example         The first two equations of the line are useful when a value is given: one can immediately find the corresponding point on the line. These forms are good when calculating with a computer; most software programs easily handle equations in these formats. (For instance, the graphics program that made Figure can be given the input (2-t,3+t,1+2*t) for .).  Does the point lie on the line? The graph in Figure makes it clear that it does not. We can answer this question without the graph using any of the three equation forms. Of the three, the symmetric equations are probably best suited for this task. Simply plug in the values of , and and see if equality is maintained: .  We see that does not lie on the line as it did not satisfy the symmetric equations.     Finding the equation of a line through two points   Find the parametric equations of the line through the points and .    Video solution     Recall the statement made at the beginning of this section: to find the equation of a line, we need a point and a direction. We have two points; either one will suffice. The direction of the line can be found by the vector with initial point and terminal point : .  The parametric equations of the line through in the direction of are: .   A graph of the line in Example         A graph of the points and line are given in Figure . Note how in the given parametrization of the line, corresponds to the point , and corresponds to the point . This relates to the understanding of the vector equation of a line described in Figure . The parametric equations start at the point , and determines how far in the direction of to travel. When , we travel 0 lengths of ; when , we travel one length of , resulting in the point .      Parallel, Intersecting and Skew Lines  In the plane, two distinct lines can either be parallel or they will intersect at exactly one point. In space, given equations of two lines, it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether the lines are distinct or not ( , the same line can be represented in different ways). Given lines and , we have four possibilities: and are lines skew  lines parallel  lines intersecting      the same line  they share all points    intersecting lines  they share only 1 point;    parallel lines  , no points in common;    skew lines  , no points in common.     The next two examples investigate these possibilities.   Comparing lines   Consider lines and , given in parametric equation form: .  Determine whether and are the same line, intersect, are parallel, or skew.    Video solution     We start by looking at the directions of each line. Line has the direction given by and line has the direction given by . It should be clear that and are not parallel, hence and are not the same line, nor are they parallel. Figure verifies this fact (where the points and directions indicated by the equations of each line are identified).   Sketching the lines from Example         We next check to see if they intersect (if they do not, they are skew lines). To find if they intersect, we look for and values such that the respective , and values are the same. That is, we want and such that: .  This is a relatively simple system of linear equations. Since the last equation is already solved for , substitute that value of into the equation above it: .  A key to remember is that we have three equations; we need to check if satisfies the first equation as well: .  It does not. Therefore, we conclude that the lines and are skew.     Comparing lines   Consider lines and , given in parametric equation form:   Determine whether and are the same line, intersect, are parallel, or skew.    It is obviously very difficult to simply look at these equations and discern anything. This is done intentionally. In the real world, most equations that are used do not have nice, integer coefficients. Rather, there are lots of digits after the decimal and the equations can look messy.   We again start by deciding whether or not each line has the same direction. The direction of is given by and the direction of is given by . When it is not clear through observation whether two vectors are parallel or not, the standard way of determining this is by comparing their respective unit vectors. Using a calculator, we find: .  The two vectors seem to be parallel (at least, their components are equal to 4 decimal places). In most situations, it would suffice to conclude that the lines are at least parallel, if not the same. One way to be sure is to rewrite and in terms of fractions, not decimals. We have .  One can then find the magnitudes of each vector in terms of fractions, then compute the unit vectors likewise. After a lot of manual arithmetic (or after briefly using a computer algebra system), one finds that .  We can now say without equivocation that these lines are parallel.  Are they the same line? The parametric equations for a line describe one point that lies on the line, so we know that the point lies on . To determine if this point also lies on , plug in the , and values of into the symmetric equations for : .   Graphing the lines in Example         The point lies on both lines, so we conclude they are the same line, just parametrized differently. Figure graphs this line along with the points and vectors described by the parametric equations. Note how and are parallel, though point in opposite directions (as indicated by their unit vectors above).      Distances  Given a point and a line in space, it is often useful to know the distance from the point to the line. (Here we use the standard definition of distance,  , the length of the shortest line segment from the point to the line.) Identifying with the point , Figure will help establish a general method of computing this distance .   Establishing the distance from a point to a line         From trigonometry, we know . We have a similar identity involving the cross product: . Divide both sides of this latter equation by to obtain : .   Determining distance from a line to a point    It is also useful to determine the distance between lines, which we define as the length of the shortest line segment that connects the two lines (an argument from geometry shows that this line segments is perpendicular to both lines). Let lines and be given, as shown in Figure . To find the direction orthogonal to both and , we take the cross product: . The magnitude of the orthogonal projection of onto is the distance we seek: .   Establishing the distance between lines         A problem in the Exercise section is to show that this distance is 0 when the lines intersect. Note the use of the Triple Scalar Product: .   Determining distance between skew lines    The following Key Idea restates these two distance formulas.   Distances to Lines     Let be a point on a line that is parallel to . The distance from a point to the line is: distance between point and line  distance between lines  lines distances between  .    Let be a point on line that is parallel to , and let be a point on line parallel to , and let , where lines and are not parallel. The distance between the two lines is: .       Finding the distance from a point to a line   Find the distance from the point to the line .    Video solution     The equation of the line gives us the point that lies on the line, hence . The equation also gives . Following Key Idea , we have the distance as .  The point is approximately units from the line .     Finding the distance between lines   Find the distance between the lines     Video solution     These are the sames lines as given in Example , where we showed them to be skew. The equations allow us to identify the following points and vectors: . .  From Key Idea we have the distance between the two lines is .  The lines are approximately 5.334 units apart.    One of the key points to understand from this section is this: to describe a line, we need a point and a direction. Whenever a problem is posed concerning a line, one needs to take whatever information is offered and glean point and direction information. Many questions can be asked (and are asked in the Exercise section) whose answer immediately follows from this understanding.  Lines are one of two fundamental objects of study in space. The other fundamental object is the plane , which we study in detail in the next section. Many complex three dimensional objects are studied by approximating their surfaces with lines and planes.     Terms and Concepts   To find an equation of a line, what two pieces of information are needed?   A point on the line and the direction of the line.    Two distinct lines in the plane can intersect or be .   parallel    Two distinct lines in space can intersect, be or be .   parallel, skew    Use your own words to describe what it means for two lines in space to be skew.

Find the distance between the line and the line               The following exercises explore special cases of the distance formulas found in Key Idea .    Let be a point on the line . Show why the distance formula correctly gives the distance from the point to the line as .   Since both and are on the line, is parallel to . Thus , giving a distance of .    Let lines and be intersecting lines. Show why the distance formula correctly gives the distance between these lines as .   (Note: this solution is easier once one has studied Section .) Since the two lines intersect, we can state for some scalars and . (Here we abuse notation slightly and add points to vectors.) Thus . Vector is the cross product of and , hence is orthogonal to both, and hence is orthogonal to . Thus , and the distance between lines is .    Let lines and be parallel.     Show why the distance formula for distance between lines cannot be used as stated to find the distance between the lines.    Show why letting allows one to the use the formula.    Show how one can use the formula for the distance between a point and a line to find the distance between parallel lines.         The distance formula cannot be used because since and are parallel, is and we cannot divide by .    Since and are parallel, lies in the plane formed by the two lines. Thus is orthogonal to this plane, and is parallel to the plane, but still orthogonal to both and . We desire the length of the projection of onto , which is what the formula provides.    Since the lines are parallel, one can measure the distance between the lines at any location on either line (just as to find the distance between straight railroad tracks, one can use a measuring tape anywhere along the track, not just at one specific place.) Let and as given by the equations of the lines, and apply the formula for distance between a point and a line.         "

It is obviously very difficult to simply look at these equations and discern anything. This is done intentionally.

We again start by deciding whether or not each line has the same direction. The direction of is given by and the direction of is given by . When it is not clear through observation whether two vectors are parallel or not, the standard way of determining this is by comparing their respective unit vectors. Using a calculator, we find: .  The two vectors seem to be parallel (at least, their components are equal to 4 decimal places). In most situations, it would suffice to conclude that the lines are at least parallel, if not the same. One way to be sure is to rewrite and in terms of fractions, not decimals. We have .  One can then find the magnitudes of each vector in terms of fractions, then compute the unit vectors likewise.

Consider a piece of cardboard with a point marked on it. One can take a nail and stick it into the cardboard at such that the nail is perpendicular to the cardboard; see Figure .   Illustrating defining a plane with a sheet of cardboard and a nail         This nail provides a handle for the cardboard. Moving the cardboard around moves to different locations in space. Tilting the nail (but keeping fixed) tilts the cardboard. Both moving and tilting the cardboard defines a different plane in space. In fact, we can define a plane by: 1) the location of in space, and 2) the direction of the nail.   Video inroduction to    The previous section showed that one can define a line given a point on the line and the direction of the line (usually given by a vector). One can make a similar statement about planes: we can define a plane in space given a point on the plane and the direction the plane faces (using the description above, the direction of the nail). Once again, the direction information will be supplied by a vector, called a normal vector , that is orthogonal to the plane. vectors normal vector  normal vector  planes normal vector   What exactly does orthogonal to the plane mean? Choose any two points and in the plane, and consider the vector . We say a vector is orthogonal to the plane if is perpendicular to for all choices of and ; that is, if for all and .  This gives us way of writing an equation describing the plane. Let be a point in the plane and let be a normal vector to the plane. A point lies in the plane defined by and if, and only if, is orthogonal to . Knowing , consider: . Equation defines an implicit function describing the plane. More algebra produces: . The right hand side is just a number, so we replace it with : . As long as , we can solve for : .  Equation is especially useful as many computer programs can graph functions in this form. Equations and have specific names, given next.   Equations of a Plane in Standard and General Forms   The plane passing through the point with normal vector can be described by an equation with standard form  the equation's general form is planes equations of  .    A key to remember throughout this section is this: to find the equation of a plane, we need a point and a normal vector. We will give several examples of finding the equation of a plane, and in each one different types of information are given. In each case, we need to use the given information to find a point on the plane and a normal vector.   Finding the equation of a plane   Write the equation of the plane that passes through the points , and in standard form.    Video solution     We need a vector that is orthogonal to the plane. Since , and are in the plane, so are the vectors and ; is orthogonal to and and hence the plane itself.  It is straightforward to compute . We can use any point we wish in the plane (any of , or will do) and we arbitrarily choose . Following Definition , the equation of the plane in standard form is .  The plane is sketched in Figure .   Sketching the plane in Example           We have just demonstrated the fact that any three non-collinear points define a plane. (This is why a three-legged stool does not rock; it's three feet always lie in a plane. A four-legged stool will rock unless all four feet lie in the same plane.)   Finding the equation of a plane   Verify that lines and , whose parametric equations are given below, intersect, then give the equation of the plane that contains these two lines in general form.     The lines clearly are not parallel. If they do not intersect, they are skew, meaning there is not a plane that contains them both. If they do intersect, there is such a plane.  To find their point of intersection, we set the , and equations equal to each other and solve for and : .  When and , the lines intersect at the point .  Let and be the directions of lines and , respectively. A normal vector to the plane containing these the two lines will also be orthogonal to and . Thus we find a normal vector by computing .  We can pick any point in the plane with which to write our equation; each line gives us infinite choices of points. We choose , the point of intersection. We follow Definition to write the plane's equation in general form: .  The plane's equation in general form is ; it is sketched in Figure .   Sketching the plane in Example            Finding the equation of a plane   Give the equation, in standard form, of the plane that passes through the point and is orthogonal to the line with vector equation .    Video solution     As the plane is to be orthogonal to the line, the plane must be orthogonal to the direction of the line given by . We use this as our normal vector. Thus the plane's equation, in standard form, is .  The line and plane are sketched in Figure .   The line and plane in Example            Finding the intersection of two planes   Give the parametric equations of the line that is the intersection of the planes and , where:     Video solution     To find an equation of a line, we need a point on the line and the direction of the line.  We can find a point on the line by solving each equation of the planes for :   We can now set these two equations equal to each other ( , we are finding values of and where the planes have the same value):   We can choose any value for ; we choose . This determines that . We can now use the equations of either plane to find : when and , on both planes. We have found a point on the line: .  We now need the direction of the line. Since the line lies in each plane, its direction is orthogonal to a normal vector for each plane. Considering the equations for and , we can quickly determine their normal vectors. For , and for , . A direction orthogonal to both of these directions is their cross product: .  The parametric equations of the line through in the direction of is: .  The planes and line are graphed in Figure .   Graphing the planes and their line of intersection in Example          An alternative method for solving       Finding the intersection of a plane and a line   Find the point of intersection, if any, of the line and the plane with equation in general form .    Video solution     The equation of the plane shows that the vector is a normal vector to the plane, and the equation of the line shows that the line moves parallel to . Since these are not orthogonal, we know there is a point of intersection. (If there were orthogonal, it would mean that the plane and line were parallel to each other, either never intersecting or the line was in the plane itself.)  To find the point of intersection, we need to find a value such that satisfies the equation of the plane. Rewriting the equation of the line with parametric equations will help: .  Replacing , and in the equation of the plane with the expressions containing found in the equation of the line allows us to determine a value that indicates the point of intersection: .  When , the point on the line satisfies the equation of the plane; that point is . Thus the point is the point of intersection between the plane and the line, illustrated in Figure .   Illustrating the intersection of a line and a plane in Example             Distances  Just as it was useful to find distances between points and lines in the previous section, it is also often necessary to find the distance from a point to a plane.   Video introduction to    Consider Figure , where a plane with normal vector is sketched containing a point and a point , not on the plane, is given. We measure the distance from to the plane by measuring the length of the projection of onto . That is, we want:   Equation is important as it does more than just give the distance between a point and a plane. We will see how it allows us to find several other distances as well: the distance between parallel planes and the distance from a line and a plane. Because Equation is important, we restate it as a Key Idea.   Illustrating finding the distance from a point to a plane          Distance from a Point to a Plane  Let a plane with normal vector be given, and let be a point. The distance from to the plane is , where is any point in the plane. planes distance between point and plane  distance between point and plane     Distance between a point and a plane   Find the distance between the point and the plane with equation .    Video solution     Using the equation of the plane, we find the normal vector . To find a point on the plane, we can let and be anything we choose, then let be whatever satisfies the equation. Letting and be 0 seems simple; this makes . Thus we let , and .  The distance from to the plane is given by Key Idea : .    We can use Key Idea to find other distances. Given two parallel planes, we can find the distance between these planes by letting be a point on one plane and a point on the other. If is a line parallel to a plane, we can use the Key Idea to find the distance between them as well: again, let be a point in the plane and let be any point on the line. (One can also use Key Idea .) The Exercise section contains problems of these types.  These past two sections have not explored lines and planes in space as an exercise of mathematical curiosity. However, there are many, many applications of these fundamental concepts. Complex shapes can be modeled (or, approximated ) using planes. For instance, part of the exterior of an aircraft may have a complex, yet smooth, shape, and engineers will want to know how air flows across this piece as well as how heat might build up due to air friction. Many equations that help determine air flow and heat dissipation are difficult to apply to arbitrary surfaces, but simple to apply to planes. By approximating a surface with millions of small planes one can more readily model the needed behavior.     Terms and Concepts   In order to find the equation of a plane, what two pieces of information must one have?   A point in the plane and a normal vector ( , a direction orthogonal to the plane).    What is the relationship between a plane and one of its normal vectors?   A normal vector is orthogonal to the plane.     Problems    In the following exercises, give any two points in the given plane.        Answers will vary.     List any two points in the plane with equation                 Answers will vary.

If is any point in the plane, and is also in the plane, then lies parallel to the plane and is orthogonal to , the normal vector. Thus , giving the distance as 0.    How is Exercise in Section easier to answer once we have an understanding of planes?   The intersecting lines define a plane with normal vector . Since points and lie in the plane, is orthogonal to , hence , giving a distance of 0. Knowing the principles of planes, especially their normal vectors, makes this simpler.     "

  "body": " Vector-Valued Functions   We are very familiar with real valued functions , that is, functions whose output is a real number. This section introduces vector-valued functions  functions whose output is a vector.   Video introduction to     Vector-Valued Functions   A vector-valued function is a function of the form , where , and are real valued functions.  The domain of is the set of all values of for which is defined. The range of is the set of all possible output vectors . vector-valued function definition  function vector-valued       Evaluating and Graphing Vector-Valued Functions  Evaluating a vector-valued function at a specific value of is straightforward; simply evaluate each component function at that value of . For instance, if , then . We can sketch this vector, as is done in Figure . Plotting lots of vectors is cumbersome, though, so generally we do not sketch the whole vector but just the terminal point. The graph of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points of , where the initial point of each vector is always the origin. In Figure we sketch the graph of ; we can indicate individual points on the graph with their respective vector, as shown. vector-valued function graphing    Sketching the graph of a vector-valued function                       Vector-valued functions are closely related to parametric equations of graphs. While in both methods we plot points or to produce a graph, in the context of vector-valued functions each such point represents a vector. The implications of this will be more fully realized in the next section as we apply calculus ideas to these functions.   Graphing vector-valued functions   Graph , for . Sketch and .    Video solution     We start by making a table of , and values as shown in Figure . Plotting these points gives an indication of what the graph looks like. In Figure , we indicate these points and sketch the full graph. We also highlight and on the graph.   Sketching the vector-valued function of Example                   1\/5      1\/2           1\/2      1\/5                   Graphing vector-valued functions   Graph for .    Video solution     We can again plot points, but careful consideration of this function is very revealing. Momentarily ignoring the third component, we see the and components trace out a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. Noticing that the component is , we see that as the graph winds around the -axis, it is also increasing at a constant rate in the positive direction, forming a spiral. This is graphed in Figure . In the graph is highlighted to help us understand the graph.   The graph of in Example             Algebra of Vector-Valued Functions   Operations on Vector-Valued Functions   Let and be vector-valued functions in and let be a scalar. Then:      .     .     A similar definition holds for vector-valued functions in . vector-valued function algebra of     This definition states that we add, subtract and scale vector-valued functions component-wise. Combining vector-valued functions in this way can be very useful (as well as create interesting graphs).   Video presentation of     Adding and scaling vector-valued functions   Let , and . Graph , , and on .    Video solution     We can graph and easily by plotting points (or just using technology). Let's think about each for a moment to better understand how vector-valued functions work.  We can rewrite as . That is, the function scales the vector by . This scaling of a vector produces a line in the direction of .  We are familiar with ; it traces out a circle, centered at the origin, of radius 1. Figure graphs and .  Adding to produces , graphed in Figure . The linear movement of the line combines with the circle to create loops that move in the direction of . (We encourage the reader to experiment by changing to , etc., and observe the effects on the loops.)   Graphing the functions in Example                                Multiplying by 5 scales the function by 5, producing , which is graphed in Figure along with . The new function is 5 times bigger than . Note how the graph of in Figure looks identical to the graph of in Figure . This is due to the fact that the and bounds of the plot in Figure are exactly 5 times larger than the bounds in Figure .     Adding and scaling vector-valued functions   A cycloid is a graph traced by a point on a rolling circle, as shown in Figure . Find an equation describing the cycloid, where the circle has radius 1. cycloid     Tracing a cycloid          Video solution     This problem is not very difficult if we approach it in a clever way. We start by letting describe the position of the point on the circle, where the circle is centered at the origin and only rotates clockwise ( , it does not roll). This is relatively simple given our previous experiences with parametric equations; .  We now want the circle to roll. We represent this by letting represent the location of the center of the circle. It should be clear that the component of should be 1; the center of the circle is always going to be 1 if it rolls on a horizontal surface.  The component of is a linear function of : for some scalar . When , (the circle starts centered on the -axis). When , the circle has made one complete revolution, traveling a distance equal to its circumference, which is also . This gives us a point on our line , the point . It should be clear that and . So .  We now combine and together to form the equation of the cycloid: , which is graphed in Figure .   The cycloid in Example             Displacement  A vector-valued function is often used to describe the position of a moving object at time . At , the object is at ; at , the object is at . Knowing the locations and give no indication of the path taken between them, but often we only care about the difference of the locations, , the displacement . displacement  vector-valued function displacement    Displacement   Let be a vector-valued function and let be values in the domain. The displacement  of , from to , is .     Video presentation of    When the displacement vector is drawn with initial point at , its terminal point is . We think of it as the vector which points from a starting position to an ending position.   Finding and graphing displacement vectors   Let . Graph on , and find the displacement of on this interval.    Video solution     The function traces out the unit circle, though at a different rate than the usual  parametrization. At , we have ; at , we have . The displacement of on is thus .   Graphing the displacement of a position function in Example         A graph of on is given in Figure , along with the displacement vector on this interval.    Measuring displacement makes us contemplate related, yet very different, concepts. Considering the semi-circular path the object in Example took, we can quickly verify that the object ended up a distance of 2 units from its initial location. That is, we can compute . However, measuring distance from the starting point is different from measuring distance traveled . Being a semi-circle, we can measure the distance traveled by this object as units. Knowing distance from the starting point allows us to compute average rate of change.    Average Rate of Change   Let be a vector-valued function, where each of its component functions is continuous on its domain, and let . The average rate of change of on is average rate of change  vector-valued function average rate of change  .     Average rate of change   Let as in Example . Find the average rate of change of on and on .    Video solution     We computed in Example that the displacement of on was . Thus the average rate of change of on is: .  We interpret this as follows: the object followed a semi-circular path, meaning it moved towards the right then moved back to the left, while climbing slowly, then quickly, then slowly again. On average , however, it progressed straight up at a constant rate of per unit of time.  We can quickly see that the displacement on is the same as on , so . The average rate of change is different, though: .  As it took 3 times as long to arrive at the same place, this average rate of change on is the average rate of change on .    We considered average rates of change in Sections and as we studied limits and derivatives. The same is true here; in the following section we apply calculus concepts to vector-valued functions as we find limits, derivatives, and integrals. Understanding the average rate of change will give us an understanding of the derivative; displacement gives us one application of integration.     Terms and Concepts   Vector-valued functions are closely related to of graphs.   parametric equations    When sketching vector-valued functions, technically one isn't graphing points, but rather .   vectors    It can be useful to think of as a vector that points from a starting position to an ending position.   displacement    In the context of vector-valued functions, average rate of change is divided by time.   displacement     Problems    In the following exercises, sketch the vector-valued function on the given interval.     , for .            , for .            , for .            , for .            , for .            , on .            , on .            , on .

  "title": "Calculus and Vector-Valued Functions",
  "body": " Calculus and Vector-Valued Functions   The previous section introduced us to a new mathematical object, the vector-valued function. We now apply calculus concepts to these functions. We start with the limit, then work our way through derivatives to integrals.    Limits of Vector-Valued Functions  The initial definition of the limit of a vector-valued function is a bit intimidating, as was the definition of the limit in Definition . The theorem following the definition shows that in practice, taking limits of vector-valued functions is no more difficult than taking limits of real-valued functions.   We can define one-sided limits in a manner very similar to Definition .    Limits of Vector-Valued Functions   Let be an open interval containing , and let be a vector-valued function defined on , except possibly at . The limit of , as approaches , is , expressed as , means that given any , there exists a such that for all , if , we have . vector-valued function limits  limit of vector-valued functions     Note how the measurement of distance between real numbers is the absolute value of their difference; the measure of distance between vectors is the vector norm, or magnitude, of their difference.   Theorem states that we can compute limits of vector-valued functions component-wise.   Limits of Vector-Valued Functions      Let be a vector-valued function in defined on an open interval containing , except possibly at . Then vector-valued function limits  limit of vector-valued functions  .    Let be a vector-valued function in defined on an open interval containing , except possibly at . Then         Video presentation of and     Finding limits of vector-valued functions   Let . Find .    Video solution     We apply the theorem and compute limits component-wise. .      Continuity   Continuity of Vector-Valued Functions   Let be a vector-valued function defined on an open interval containing . vector-valued function continuity  continuous function vector-valued     is continuous at if .    If is continuous at all in , then is continuous on .         Using one-sided limits, we can also define continuity on closed intervals as done before.   We again have a theorem that lets us evaluate continuity component-wise.   Continuity of Vector-Valued Functions   Let be a vector-valued function defined on an open interval containing . Then is continuous at if, and only if, each of its component functions is continuous at . vector-valued function continuity  continuous function vector-valued      Video presentation of     Evaluating continuity of vector-valued functions   Let . Determine whether is continuous at and .    While the second and third components of are defined at , the first component, , is not. Since the first component is not even defined at , is not defined at , and hence it is not continuous at .  At each of the component functions is continuous. Therefore is continuous at .      Derivatives  Consider a vector-valued function defined on an open interval containing and . We can compute the displacement of on , as shown in Figure . Recall that dividing the displacement vector by gives the average rate of change on , as shown in Figure .   Illustrating displacement, leading to an understanding of the derivative of vector-valued functions                       The derivative of a vector-valued function is a measure of the instantaneous rate of change, measured by taking the limit as the length of goes to 0. Instead of thinking of an interval as , we think of it as for some value of (hence the interval has length ). The average rate of change is for any value of . We take the limit as to measure the instantaneous rate of change; this is the derivative of .   Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function   Let be continuous on an open interval containing . vector-valued function derivatives  derivative vector-valued functions    The derivative of at is .    The derivative of is .        Alternate notations for the derivative of include: .   If a vector-valued function has a derivative for all in an open interval , we say that is differentiable on .  Once again we might view this definition as intimidating, but recall that we can evaluate limits component-wise. The following theorem verifies that this means we can compute derivatives component-wise as well, making the task not too difficult.   Again, using one-sided limits, we can define differentiability on closed intervals. We'll make use of this a few times in this chapter.    Derivatives of Vector-Valued Functions      Let . Then .    Let . Then vector-valued function derivatives  derivative vector-valued functions  .        Video presentation of and     Derivatives of vector-valued functions   Let .

Note how plotting the two of these together, in this way, is not very illuminating. When dealing with real-valued functions, plotting with gave us useful information as we were able to compare and at the same -values. When dealing with vector-valued functions, it is hard to tell which points on the graph of correspond to which points on the graph of .    We easily compute , which is drawn in Figure with its initial point at the origin, as well as at . These are sketched in Figure .   Graphing the derivative of a vector-valued function in Example                             Derivatives of vector-valued functions   Let . Compute and . Sketch with its initial point at the origin and at .    We compute as . At , we have . Figure shows a graph of , with plotted with its initial point at the origin and at .   Viewing a vector-valued function and its derivative at one point          In Examples and , sketching a particular derivative with its initial point at the origin did not seem to reveal anything significant. However, when we sketched the vector with its initial point on the corresponding point on the graph, we did see something significant: the vector appeared to be tangent to the graph. We have not yet defined what tangent means in terms of curves in space; in fact, we use the derivative to define this term.   Tangent Vector, Tangent Line   Let be a differentiable vector-valued function on an open interval containing , where . tangent line  vector-valued function tangent line      A vector is tangent to the graph of at if is parallel to .    The tangent line to the graph of at is the line through with direction parallel to . An equation of the tangent line is .        Video presentation of     Finding tangent lines to curves in space   Let on . Find the vector equation of the line tangent to the graph of at .    Video solution     To find the equation of a line, we need a point on the line and the line's direction. The point is given by . (To be clear, is a vector , not a point, but we use the point pointed to by this vector.)  The direction comes from . We compute, component-wise, . Thus .   Graphing a curve in space with its tangent line         The vector equation of the line is . This line and are sketched in Figure .     Finding tangent lines to curves   Find the equations of the lines tangent to at and .    Video solution     We find that . At , we have , so the equation of the line tangent to the graph of at is .  This line is graphed with in Figure .   Graphing and its tangent line in Example         At , we have ! This implies that the tangent line has no direction. We cannot apply Definition , hence cannot find the equation of the tangent line.    We were unable to compute the equation of the tangent line to at because . The graph in Figure shows that there is a cusp at this point. This leads us to another definition of smooth , previously defined by Definition in Section .   Smooth Vector-Valued Functions   Let be a differentiable vector-valued function on an open interval where is continuous on . is smooth on if on . smooth  vector-valued function smooth      Video presentation of    Having established derivatives of vector-valued functions, we now explore the relationships between the derivative and other vector operations. The following theorem states how the derivative interacts with vector addition and the various vector products.   Properties of Derivatives of Vector-Valued Functions   Let and be differentiable vector-valued functions, let be a differentiable real-valued function, and let be a real number. vector-valued function derivatives  derivative vector-valued functions  dot product and derivatives  cross product and derivatives                  Product Rule       Product Rule       Product Rule       Chain Rule         Video presentation of     Using derivative properties of vector-valued functions   Let and let be the unit vector that points in the direction of .     Graph and on the same axes, on .    Find and sketch , and . Sketch each with initial point the corresponding point on the graph of .       Video solution        To form the unit vector that points in the direction of , we need to divide by its magnitude. . and are graphed in Figure . Note how the graph of forms part of a circle; this must be the case, as the length of is 1 for all .   Graphing and in Example           To compute , we use Theorem , writing . (We could write and then take the derivative. It is a matter of preference; this latter method requires two applications of the Quotient Rule where our method uses the Product and Chain Rules.) We find using the Chain Rule: We now find using part 3 of Theorem : . This is admittedly very messy; such is usually the case when we deal with unit vectors. We can use this formula to compute , and :    Graphing some of the derivatives of in Example         Each of these is sketched in Figure . Note how the length of the vector gives an indication of how quickly the circle is being traced at that point. When , the circle is being drawn relatively slow; when , the circle is being traced much more quickly.       It is a basic geometric fact that a line tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the line passing through the center of the circle and . This is illustrated in Figure ; each tangent vector is perpendicular to the line that passes through its initial point and the center of the circle. Since the center of the circle is the origin, we can state this another way: is orthogonal to .  Recall that the dot product serves as a test for orthogonality: if , then is orthogonal to . Thus in the above example, .  This is true of any vector-valued function that has a constant length, that is, that traces out part of a circle. It has important implications later on, so we state it as a theorem (and leave its formal proof as an Exercise.)   Vector-Valued Functions of Constant Length   Let be a vector-valued function of constant length that is differentiable on an open interval . That is, for all in ; equivalently, for all in . Then for all in . vector-valued function of constant length       Integration  Before formally defining integrals of vector-valued functions, consider the following equation that our calculus experience tells us should be true: .  That is, the integral of a rate of change function should give total change. In the context of vector-valued functions, this total change is displacement. The above equation is true; we now develop the theory to show why.  We can define antiderivatives and the indefinite integral of vector-valued functions in the same manner we defined indefinite integrals in Definition . However, we cannot define the definite integral of a vector-valued function as we did in Definition . That definition was based on the signed area between a function and the -axis. An area-based definition will not be useful in the context of vector-valued functions. Instead, we define the definite integral of a vector-valued function in a manner similar to that of Theorem , utilizing Riemann sums.   Antiderivatives, Indefinite and Definite Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions   Let be a continuous vector-valued function on . An antiderivative of is a function such that .  The set of all antiderivatives of is the indefinite integral of , denoted by .  The definite integral of on is , where is the length of the th subinterval of a partition of , is the length of the largest subinterval in the partition, and is any value in the th subinterval of the partition. antiderivative of vector-valued function  definite integral of vector-valued function  indefinite integral of vector-valued function  integration of vector-valued function     It is probably difficult to infer meaning from the definition of the definite integral. The important thing to realize from the definition is that it is built upon limits, which we can evaluate component-wise.  The following theorem simplifies the computation of definite integrals; the rest of this section and the following section will give meaning and application to these integrals.   Indefinite and Definite Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions   Let be a vector-valued function in that is continuous on .                A similar statement holds for vector-valued functions in . vector-valued function integration  integration of vector-valued functions      Video presentation of and     Evaluating a definite integral of a vector-valued function   Let . Evaluate .    Video solution     We follow Theorem . .     Solving an initial value problem   Let . Find where:      and     .       Video solution     Knowing , we find by evaluating the indefinite integral. .  Note how each indefinite integral creates its own constant which we collect as one constant vector . Knowing allows us to solve for : .  So . To find , we integrate once more. .  With , we solve for : .  So .    What does the integration of a vector-valued function mean ? There are many applications, but none as direct as the area under the curve that we used in understanding the integral of a real-valued function.  A key understanding for us comes from considering the integral of a derivative: .  Integrating a rate of change function gives displacement . displacement   Noting that vector-valued functions are closely related to parametric equations, we can describe the arc length of the graph of a vector-valued function as an integral. Given parametric equations , , the arc length on of the graph is , as stated in Theorem in Section . If , note that . Therefore we can express the arc length of the graph of a vector-valued function as an integral of the magnitude of its derivative.   Arc Length of a Vector-Valued Function   Let be a vector-valued function where is continuous on . The arc length of the graph of is vector-valued function arc length  arc length  .    Note that we are actually integrating a scalar-function here, not a vector-valued function.  The next section takes what we have established thus far and applies it to objects in motion. We will let describe the path of an object in the plane or in space and will discover the information provided by and .     Terms and Concepts   Limits, derivatives and integrals of vector-valued functions are all evaluated -wise.   component    The definite integral of a rate of change function gives .   displacement    Why is it generally not useful to graph both and on the same axes?   It is difficult to identify the points on the graphs of and that correspond to each other.     Theorem contains three product rules. What are the three different types of products used in these rules?   A scalar-vector product, a dot product and a cross product.     Problems    Evaluate the given limit.                                        , where .          Identify the interval or union of intervals on which is continuous.

Video solution        Taking derivatives, we find . Note that acceleration is constant.     , ; , . These are plotted with in Figure . We can think of acceleration as pulling the velocity vector in a certain direction. At , the velocity vector points down and to the left; at , the velocity vector has been pulled in the direction and is now pointing up and to the right. In Figure we plot more velocity\/acceleration vectors, making more clear the effect acceleration has on velocity.   Graphing the position, velocity and acceleration of an object in Example                       Since is constant in this example, as grows large becomes almost parallel to . For instance, when , , which is nearly parallel to .    The object's speed is given by . To find the minimal speed, we could apply calculus techniques (such as set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for , etc.) but we can find it by inspection. Inside the square root we have a quadratic which is minimized when . Thus the speed is minimized at , with a speed of  . The graph in Figure also implies speed is minimized here. The filled dots on the graph are located at integer values of between and 3. Dots that are far apart imply the object traveled a far distance in 1 second, indicating high speed; dots that are close together imply the object did not travel far in 1 second, indicating a low speed. The dots are closest together near , implying the speed is minimized near that value.        Analyzing Motion   Two objects follow an identical path at different rates on . The position function for Object 1 is ; the position function for Object 2 is , where distances are measured in feet and time is measured in seconds. Compare the velocity, speed and acceleration of the two objects on the path.    We begin by computing the velocity and acceleration function for each object:   We immediately see that Object 1 has constant acceleration, whereas Object 2 does not.  At , we have and ; the velocity of Object 2 is three times that of Object 1 and so it follows that the speed of Object 2 is three times that of Object 1 ( ft\/s compared to ft\/s.)   Plotting velocity and acceleration vectors for Object 1 in Example         At , the velocity of Object 1 is and the velocity of Object 2 is ! This tells us that Object 2 comes to a complete stop at .  In Figure , we see the velocity and acceleration vectors for Object 1 plotted for and . Note again how the constant acceleration vector seems to pull the velocity vector from pointing down, right to up, right. We could plot the analogous picture for Object 2, but the velocity and acceleration vectors are rather large ( !)  Instead, we simply plot the locations of Object 1 and 2 on intervals of of a second, shown in Figure and Figure . Note how the -values of Object 1 increase at a steady rate. This is because the -component of is 0; there is no acceleration in the -component. The dots are not evenly spaced; the object is moving faster near and than near .   Comparing the positions of Objects 1 and 2 in Example                       In Figure , we see the points plotted for Object 2. Note the large change in position from to ; the object starts moving very quickly. However, it slows considerably at it approaches the origin, and comes to a complete stop at . While it looks like there are 3 points near the origin, there are in reality 5 points there.  Since the objects begin and end at the same location, they have the same displacement. Since they begin and end at the same time, with the same displacement, they have the same average rate of change ( , they have the same average velocity). Since they follow the same path, they have the same distance traveled. Even though these three measurements are the same, the objects obviously travel the path in very different ways.     Analyzing the motion of a whirling ball on a string   A young boy whirls a ball, attached to a string, above his head in a counter-clockwise circle. The ball follows a circular path and makes 2 revolutions per second. The string has length 2 .     Find the position function that describes this situation.    Find the acceleration of the ball and give a physical interpretation of it.    A tree stands 10 in front of the boy. At what -values should the boy release the string so that the ball hits the tree?       Video solution        The ball whirls in a circle. Since the string is 2ft long, the radius of the circle is 2. The position function describes a circle with radius 2, centered at the origin, but makes a full revolution every seconds, not two revolutions per second. We modify the period of the trigonometric functions to be 1\/2 by multiplying by . The final position function is thus . (Plot this for to verify that one revolution is made in 1\/2 a second.)    To find , we take the derivative of twice. . Note how is parallel to , but has a different magnitude and points in the opposite direction. Why is this?  Recall the classic physics equation, Force mass acceleration. A force acting on a mass induces acceleration ( , the mass moves); acceleration acting on a mass induces a force (gravity gives our mass a weight ). Thus force and acceleration are closely related. A moving ball wants to travel in a straight line. Why does the ball in our example move in a circle? It is attached to the boy's hand by a string. The string applies a force to the ball, affecting its motion: the string accelerates the ball. This is not acceleration in the sense of it travels faster; rather, this acceleration is changing the velocity of the ball. In what direction is this force\/acceleration being applied? In the direction of the string, towards the boy's hand.  The magnitude of the acceleration is related to the speed at which the ball is traveling. A ball whirling quickly is rapidly changing direction\/velocity. When velocity is changing rapidly, the acceleration must be large.     When the boy releases the string, the string no longer applies a force to the ball, meaning acceleration is and the ball can now move in a straight line in the direction of .  Let be the time when the boy lets go of the string. The ball will be at , traveling in the direction of . We want to find so that this line contains the point (since the tree is 10 directly in front of the boy).   Modeling the flight of a ball in Example         There are many ways to find this time value. We choose one that is relatively simple computationally. As shown in Figure , the vector from the release point to the tree is . This line segment is tangent to the circle, which means it is also perpendicular to itself, so their dot product is 0. This is a wonderful formula. Every 1\/2 second after the boy can release the string (since the ball makes 2 revolutions per second, he has two chances each second to release the ball).        Analyzing motion in space   An object moves in a spiral with position function , where distances are measured in meters and time is in minutes. Describe the object's speed and acceleration at time .    With , we have: .  The speed of the object is  ; it moves at a constant speed. Note that the object does not accelerate in the -direction, but rather moves up at a constant rate of 1 .    The objects in Examples and traveled at a constant speed. That is, for some constant . Recall Theorem , which states that if a vector-valued function has constant length, then is perpendicular to its derivative: . In these examples, the velocity function has constant length, therefore we can conclude that the velocity is perpendicular to the acceleration: . A quick check verifies this. vector-valued function of constant length   There is an intuitive understanding of this. If acceleration is parallel to velocity, then it is only affecting the object's speed; it does not change the direction of travel. (For example, consider a dropped stone. Acceleration and velocity are parallel straight down and the direction of velocity never changes, though speed does increase.) If acceleration is not perpendicular to velocity, then there is some acceleration in the direction of travel, influencing the speed. If speed is constant, then acceleration must be orthogonal to velocity, as it then only affects direction, and not speed.   Objects With Constant Speed  If an object moves with constant speed, then its velocity and acceleration vectors are orthogonal. That is, . vector-valued function of constant length      Projectile Motion  An important application of vector-valued position functions is projectile motion : the motion of objects under only the influence of gravity. We will measure time in seconds, and distances will either be in meters or feet. We will show that we can completely describe the path of such an object knowing its initial position and initial velocity ( , where it is and where it is going .) vector-valued function projectile motion  projectile motion    Video presentation of    Suppose an object has initial position and initial velocity . It is customary to rewrite in terms of its speed and direction , where is a unit vector. Recall all unit vectors in can be written as , where is an angle measure counter-clockwise from the -axis. (We refer to as the angle of elevation. ) angle of elevation Thus .  Since the acceleration of the object is known, namely , where is the gravitational constant, we can find knowing our two initial conditions. We first find :   This text takes to be 32 when using Imperial units, and 9.8 when using SI units.    .  Knowing , we have and so .  We integrate once more to find : .   Projectile Motion  The position function of a projectile propelled from an initial position of , with initial speed , with angle of elevation and neglecting all accelerations but gravity is vector-valued function projectile motion  projectile motion  .  Letting , can be written as .   We demonstrate how to use this position function in the next two examples.   Projectile Motion   Sydney shoots her Red Ryder bb gun across level ground from an elevation of 4 , where the barrel of the gun makes a angle with the horizontal. Find how far the bb travels before landing, assuming the bb is fired at the advertised rate of 350 and ignoring air resistance.    Video solution     A direct application of Key Idea gives , where we set her initial position to be . We need to find when the bb lands, then we can find where . We accomplish this by setting the -component equal to 0 and solving for : .  (We discarded a negative solution that resulted from our quadratic equation.)  We have found that the bb lands 2.03 after firing; with , we find the -component of our position function is . The bb lands about 704 feet away.     Projectile Motion   Alex holds his sister's bb gun at a height of 3 and wants to shoot a target that is 6 above the ground, 25 away. At what angle should he hold the gun to hit his target? (We still assume the muzzle velocity is 350 .)    The position function for the path of Alex's bb is .  We need to find so that for some value of . That is, we want to find and such that .  This is not trivial (though not hard ). We start by solving each equation for and , respectively. .  Using the Pythagorean Identity , we have   Clearly the negative values do not fit our context, so we have and . Using , we can solve for : .  Alex has two choices of angle. He can hold the rifle at an angle of about with the horizontal and hit his target 0.07 after firing, or he can hold his rifle almost straight up, with an angle of , where he'll hit his target about 22 later. The first option is clearly the option he should choose.      Distance Traveled  Consider a driver who sets her cruise-control to 60 , and travels at this speed for an hour. We can ask:     How far did the driver travel?    How far from her starting position is the driver?     The first is easy to answer: she traveled 60 miles. The second is impossible to answer with the given information. We do not know if she traveled in a straight line, on an oval racetrack, or along a slowly-winding highway.  This highlights an important fact: to compute distance traveled, we need only to know the speed, given by .   Distance Traveled   Let be a velocity function for a moving object. The distance traveled by the object on is: distance traveled  vector-valued function distance traveled  integration distance traveled  .    Note that this is just a restatement of Theorem : arc length is the same as distance traveled, just viewed in a different context.   Video presentation of     Distance Traveled, Displacement, and Average Speed   A particle moves in space with position function on , where is measured in seconds and distances are in meters. Find:     The distance traveled by the particle on .    The displacement of the particle on .    The particle's average speed.       Video solution        We use Theorem to establish the integral: . This cannot be solved in terms of elementary functions so we turn to numerical integration, finding the distance to be 12.88 .    The displacement is the vector . That is, the particle ends with an -value increased by 4 and with - and -values the same (see Figure ).    We found above that the particle traveled 12.88 over 4 seconds. We can compute average speed by dividing: .   The path of the particle in Example         We should also consider Definition of Section , which says that the average value of a function on is . In our context, the average value of the speed is . Note how the physical context of a particle traveling gives meaning to a more abstract concept learned earlier.       In Definition of Chapter we defined the average value of a function on to be .  Note how in Example we computed the average speed as ; that is, we just found the average value of on .  Likewise, given position function , the average velocity on is ; that is, it is the average value of , or , on .   Average Speed, Average Velocity  Let be a differentiable position function on .  The average speed is: .  The average velocity is: .   The next two sections investigate more properties of the graphs of vector-valued functions and we'll apply these new ideas to what we just learned about motion.     Terms and Concepts   How is velocity different from speed ?   Velocity is a vector, indicating an objects direction of travel and its rate of distance change ( , its speed). Speed is a scalar.    What is the difference between displacement and distance traveled ?   Displacement is a vector, indicating the difference between the starting and ending positions of an object. Distance traveled is a scalar, indicating the arc length of the path followed.    What is the difference between average velocity and average speed ?   The average velocity is found by dividing the displacement by the time traveled it is a vector. The average speed is found by dividing the distance traveled by the time traveled it is a scalar.     Distance traveled is the same as  , just viewed in a different context.   arc length    Describe a scenario where an object's average speed is a large number, but the magnitude of the average velocity is not a large number.   One example is traveling at a constant speed in a circle, ending at the starting position. Since the displacement is , the average velocity is , hence . But traveling at constant speed means the average speed is also .    Explain why it is not possible to have an average velocity with a large magnitude but a small average speed.   Distance traveled is always greater than or equal to the magnitude of displacement, therefore average speed will always be at least as large as the magnitude of the average velocity.

A boy whirls a ball, attached to a 3 ft string, above his head in a counter-clockwise circle. The ball makes 2 revolutions per second.  At what -values should the boy release the string so that the ball heads directly for a tree standing 10 ft in front of him?   At -values of seconds, where is an integer.    David faces Goliath with only a stone in a 3 ft sling, which he whirls above his head at 4 revolutions per second. They stand 20 ft apart.     At what -values must David release the stone in his sling in order to hit Goliath?    What is the speed at which the stone is traveling when released?    Assume David releases the stone from a height of 6ft and Goliath's forehead is 9 ft above the ground. What angle of elevation must David apply to the stone to hit Goliath's head?      The stone, while whirling, can be modeled by .     For -values , where is an integer.     ft\/s    At , the stone is approximately ft from Goliath. Using the formula for projectile motion, we want the angle of elevation that lets a projectile starting at with a initial velocity of ft\/s arrive at . The desired angle is radians, or .        A hunter aims at a deer which is yards away. Her crossbow is at a height of ft, and she aims for a spot on the deer ft above the ground. The crossbow fires her arrows at ft\/s.    At what angle of elevation should she hold the crossbow to hit her target?    If the deer is moving perpendicularly to her line of sight at a rate of mph, by approximately how much should she lead the deer in order to hit it in the desired location? (How far ahead of the deer should she aim?)                    A baseball player hits a ball at 100 mph, with an initial height of 3 ft and an angle of elevation of , at Boston's Fenway Park. The ball flies towards the famed Green Monster, a wall 37 ft high located 310 ft from home plate.     Show that as hit, the ball hits the wall.    Show that if the angle of elevation is , the ball clears the Green Monster.      The position function of the ball is , where is the angle of elevation.     With , the ball reaches 310 ft from home plate in 2.25 seconds; at this time, the height of the ball is 34.9 ft, not enough to clear the Green Monster.    With , the ball reaches 310 ft from home plate in 2.26 s, with a height of 40 ft, clearing the wall.       A Cessna flies at 1000 ft at 150 mph and drops a box of supplies to the professor (and his wife) on an island. Ignoring wind resistance, how far horizontally will the supplies travel before they land?   The position function is . The -component is 0 when ; , meaning the box will travel about 1740 ft horizontally before it lands.    A football quarterback throws a pass from a height of 6 ft, intending to hit his receiver 20 yds away at a height of 5 ft.     If the ball is thrown at a rate of 50mph, what angle of elevation is needed to hit his intended target?    If the ball is thrown at with an angle of elevation of , what initial ball speed is needed to hit his target?      The position function of the ball is , where is the angle of elevation and is the initial ball speed.     With ft\/s, there are two angles of elevation possible. An angle of delivers the ball in 0.83 s, while an angle of delivers the ball in s.    With , the initial speed must be 53.8 mph ft\/s.         "

We can do a similar thing with vector-valued functions. Given in , we have 2 directions perpendicular to the tangent vector, as shown in Figure . It is good to wonder Is one of these two directions preferable over the other?    Given a direction in the plane, there are always two directions orthogonal to it         Given in , there are infinitely many vectors orthogonal to the tangent vector at a given point. Again, we might wonder Is one out of this infinite number of choices preferable over the others? Is one of these the right choice?   The answer in both and is Yes, there is one vector that is not only preferable, it is the right one to choose. Recall Theorem , which states that if has constant length, then is orthogonal to for all . We know , the unit tangent vector, has constant length. Therefore is orthogonal to . vector-valued function of constant length   We'll see that is more than just a convenient choice of vector that is orthogonal to ; rather, it is the right choice. Since all we care about is the direction, we define this newly found vector to be a unit vector.    is a unit vector, by definition. This does not imply that is also a unit vector.    Unit Normal Vector   Let be a vector-valued function where the unit tangent vector, , is smooth on an open interval . The unit normal vector  is unit normal vector definition  unit vector unit normal vector  .     Video presentation of     Computing the unit normal vector   Let as in Example . Sketch both and with initial points at .    Video solution     In Example , we found . Therefore .  Thus .  We compute and . These are sketched in Figure .   Plotting unit tangent and normal vectors in Example            There is one flaw in our definition of : it is possible that we could have ! Indeed, this is the case for any line of the form . For straight lines in the plane, it is most common to orient the normal vector counterclockwise from the tangent vector, but for lines in three dimensions, there is no preferred choice of normal vector.   The previous example was once again too nice. In general, the expression for contains fractions of square roots, hence the expression of is very messy. We demonstrate this in the next example.   Computing the unit normal vector   Let as in Example . Find and sketch with the unit tangent and normal vectors at and 1.    Video solution     In Example , we found .  Finding requires two applications of the Quotient Rule:   This is not a unit vector; to find , we need to divide by its magnitude. .  Finally, .  Using this formula for , we compute the unit tangent and normal vectors for and 1 and sketch them in Figure .   Plotting unit tangent and normal vectors in Example           The final result for in Example is suspiciously similar to . There is a clear reason for this. If is a unit vector in , then the only unit vectors orthogonal to are and . Given , we can quickly determine if we know which term to multiply by .  Consider again Figure , where we have plotted some unit tangent and normal vectors. Note how always points inside the curve, or to the concave side of the curve. This is not a coincidence; this is true in general. Knowing the direction that  turns allows us to quickly find .   Unit Normal Vectors in   Let be a vector-valued function in where is smooth on an open interval . Let be in and Then is either , whichever is the vector that points to the concave side of the graph of . unit tangent vector in  unit normal vector in       Application to Acceleration  Let be a position function. It is a fact (stated later in Theorem ) that acceleration, , lies in the plane defined by and . That is, there are scalar functions and such that .  We generally drop the of part of the notation and just write and .  The scalar measures how much acceleration is in the direction of travel, that is, it measures the component of acceleration that affects the speed. The scalar measures how much acceleration is perpendicular to the direction of travel, that is, it measures the component of acceleration that affects the direction of travel. unit tangent vector and acceleration  unit normal vector and acceleration   We can find using the orthogonal projection of onto (review Definition in Section if needed). Recalling that since is a unit vector, , so we have .  Thus the amount of in the direction of is . The same logic gives .  While this is a fine way of computing , there are simpler ways of finding (as finding itself can be complicated). The following theorem gives alternate formulas for and .   Keep in mind that both and are functions of ; that is, the scalar changes depending on . It is convention to drop the notation from and simply write .    Acceleration in the Plane Defined by and   Let be a position function with acceleration and unit tangent and normal vectors and . Then lies in the plane defined by and ; that is, there exists scalars and such that .  Moreover,      unit tangent vector and acceleration  unit normal vector and acceleration  an@  at@  unit normal vector an@  unit tangent vector at@   Note the second formula for : . This measures the rate of change of speed, which again is the amount of acceleration in the direction of travel.   Video presentation of     Computing and   Let as in Examples and . Find and .    Video solution     The previous examples give and .  We can find and directly with dot products: .  Thus , which is clearly the case.  What is the practical interpretation of these numbers? means the object is moving at a constant speed, and hence all acceleration comes in the form of direction change.     Computing and   Let as in Examples and . Find and .    Video solution     The previous examples give and .  While we can compute using , we instead demonstrate using another formula from Theorem . .  When , and . We interpret this to mean that at , the particle is accelerating mostly by increasing speed, not by changing direction. As the path near is relatively straight, this should make intuitive sense. Figure gives a graph of the path for reference.   Graphing in Example         Contrast this with , where and . Here the particle's speed is not changing and all acceleration is in the form of direction change.     Analyzing projectile motion   A ball is thrown from a height of 240 with an initial speed of 64 and an angle of elevation of . Find the position function of the ball and analyze and . projectile motion     Using Key Idea of Section we form the position function of the ball: , which we plot in Figure .   Plotting the position of a thrown ball, with 1s increments shown         From this we find and . Computing is not difficult, and with some simplification we find .  With as simple as it is, finding is also simple: .  We choose to not find and find through the formula : .   Figure gives a table of values of and . When , we see the ball's speed is decreasing; when the speed of the ball is unchanged. This corresponds to the fact that at the ball reaches its highest point.  After we see that is decreasing in value. This is because as the ball falls, its path becomes straighter and most of the acceleration is in the form of speeding up the ball, and not in changing its direction.   A table of values of and in Example                                               Our understanding of the unit tangent and normal vectors is aiding our understanding of motion. The work in Example gave quantitative analysis of what we intuitively knew.  The next section provides two more important steps towards this analysis. We currently describe position only in terms of time. In everyday life, though, we often describe position in terms of distance ( The gas station is about 2 miles ahead, on the left. ). The arc length parameter allows us to reference position in terms of distance traveled.  We also intuitively know that some paths are straighter than others and some are curvier than others, but we lack a measurement of curviness. The arc length parameter provides a way for us to compute curvature , a quantitative measurement of how curvy a curve is.     Terms and Concepts    If is a unit tangent vector, what is              If is a unit normal vector, what is             The acceleration vector lies in the plane defined by what two vectors?    and .     measures how much the acceleration is affecting the of an object.   the speed     Problems    Given , find and evaluate it at the indicated value of .     ,     ;                         ,     .

The object moves at constant speed, meaning that is always 0. The object rises along the -axis at a constant rate, so all acceleration comes in the form of changing direction circling the -axis.

Acceleration is thus always perpendicular to the direction of travel; in this particular case, it is always times the unit vector pointing orthogonal to the direction of travel.          "

  "title": "The Arc Length Parameter and Curvature",
  "body": " The Arc Length Parameter and Curvature   The Arc Length Paramtrization  In normal conversation we describe position in terms of both time and distance . For instance, imagine driving to visit a friend. If she calls and asks where you are, you might answer I am 20 minutes from your house, or you might say I am 10 miles from your house. Both answers provide your friend with a general idea of where you are.   Video introduction to    Currently, our vector-valued functions have defined points with a parameter , which we often take to represent time. Consider Figure , where is graphed and the points corresponding to and are shown. Note how the arc length between and is smaller than the arc length between and ; if the parameter is time and is position, we can say that the particle traveled faster on than on .   Introducing the arc length parameter                       Now consider Figure , where the same graph is parametrized by a different variable . Points corresponding to through are plotted. The arc length of the graph between each adjacent pair of points is 1. We can view this parameter as distance; that is, the arc length of the graph from to is 3, the arc length from to is 4, etc. If one wants to find the point 2.5 units from an initial location ( , ), one would compute . This parameter is very useful, and is called the arc length parameter . arc length parameter  arc length   How do we find the arc length parameter?  Start with any parametrization of . We can compute the arc length of the graph of on the interval with .  We can turn this into a function: as varies, we find the arc length from to . This function is .  This establishes a relationship between and . Knowing this relationship explicitly, we can rewrite as a function of : . We demonstrate this in an example.   Finding the arc length parameter   Let . Parametrize with the arc length parameter .    Video solution     Using Equation , we write .  We can integrate this, explicitly finding a relationship between and : .  Since , we can write and replace in with : .  Clearly, as shown in Figure , the graph of is a line, where corresponds to the point . What point on the line is 2 units away from this initial point? We find it with .   Graphing in Example with parameters and         Is the point really 2 units away from ? We use the Distance Formula to check: .  Yes, is indeed 2 units away, in the direction of travel, from the initial point.    Things worked out very nicely in Example ; we were able to establish directly that . Usually, the arc length parameter is much more difficult to describe in terms of , a result of integrating a square root. There are a number of things that we can learn about the arc length parameter from Equation , though, that are incredibly useful.  First, take the derivative of with respect to . The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (see Theorem ) states that .  Letting represent time and represent position, we see that the rate of change of with respect to is speed; that is, the rate of change of distance traveled is speed, which should match our intuition.  The Chain Rule states that .  Solving for , we have , where is the unit tangent vector. Equation is often misinterpreted, as one is tempted to think it states , but there is a big difference between and . The key to take from it is that is a unit vector. In fact, the following theorem states that this characterizes the arc length parameter.   Arc Length Parameter   Let be a vector-valued function. The parameter is the arc length parameter if, and only if, . arc length parameter      Video presentation of      Curvature  Consider points and on the curve graphed in Figure . One can readily argue that the curve curves more sharply at than at . It is useful to use a number to describe how sharply the curve bends; that number is the curvature of the curve.   Establishing the concept of curvature                       We derive this number in the following way. Consider Figure , where unit tangent vectors are graphed around points and . Notice how the direction of the unit tangent vector changes quite a bit near , whereas it does not change as much around . This leads to an important concept: measuring the rate of change of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length gives us a measurement of curvature.   Curvature   Let be a vector-valued function where is the arc length parameter. The curvature of the graph of is curvature  unit tangent vector and curvature  .     Video presentation of    If is parametrized by the arc length parameter, then .  Having defined , we can rewrite the second equation as .  We already knew that is in the same direction as ; that is, we can think of as being pulled in the direction of . How hard is it being pulled? By a factor of . When the curvature is large, is being pulled hard and the direction of changes rapidly. When is small, is not being pulled hard and hence its direction is not changing rapidly.  We use Definition to find the curvature of the line in Example .   Finding the curvature of a line   Use Definition to find the curvature of .    Video solution     In Example , we found that the arc length parameter was defined by , so parametrized with the arc length parameter. To find , we need to find . .  It probably comes as no surprise that the curvature of a line is 0. (How curvy is a line? It is not curvy at all.)    While the definition of curvature is a beautiful mathematical concept, it is nearly impossible to use most of the time; writing in terms of the arc length parameter is generally very hard. Fortunately, there are other methods of calculating this value that are much easier. There is a tradeoff: the definition is easy to understand though hard to compute, whereas these other formulas are easy to compute though it may be hard to understand why they work.   Formulas for Curvature   Let be a smooth curve in the plane or in space. curvature equations for    If is defined by , then .    If is defined as a vector-valued function in the plane, , then .    If is defined in space by a vector-valued function , then .       We practice using these formulas.   Finding the curvature of a circle   Find the curvature of a circle with radius , defined by . curvature of circle     Video solution     Before we start, we should expect the curvature of a circle to be constant, and not dependent on . (Why?)  We compute using the second part of Theorem . .  We have found that a circle with radius has curvature .     Example gives a great result. Before this example, if we were told The curve has a curvature of 5 at point , we would have no idea what this really meant. Is 5 big  does is correspond to a really sharp turn, or a not-so-sharp turn? Now we can think of 5 in terms of a circle with radius 1\/5. Knowing the units (inches vs. miles, for instance) allows us to determine how sharply the curve is curving.  Let a point on a smooth curve be given, and let be the curvature of the curve at . A circle that:     passes through ,    lies on the concave side of ,    has a common tangent line as at and    has radius (hence has curvature )     is the osculating circle , or circle of curvature , to at , and is the radius of curvature . curvature of circle  osculating circle  circle of curvature  radius of curvature  curvature radius of  Figure shows the graph of the curve seen earlier in Figure and its osculating circles at and . A sharp turn corresponds to a circle with a small radius; a gradual turn corresponds to a circle with a large radius. Being able to think of curvature in terms of the radius of a circle is very useful.   Illustrating the osculating circles for the curve seen in Figure          The osculating circle    (The word osculating comes from a Latin word related to kissing; an osculating circle kisses the graph at a particular point. Many beautiful ideas in mathematics have come from studying the osculating circles to a curve.)   Finding curvature   Find the curvature of the parabola defined by at the vertex and at .    We use the first formula found in Theorem . .   Examining the curvature of         At the vertex ( ), the curvature is . At , the curvature is . So at , the curvature of is that of a circle of radius ; at , the curvature is that of a circle with radius . This is illustrated in Figure . At , the curvature is ; the graph is nearly straight as the curvature is very close to 0.     Finding curvature   Find where the curvature of is maximized.    We use the third formula in Theorem as is defined in space. We leave it to the reader to verify that .   Understanding the curvature of a curve in space                       Thus   While this is not a particularly nice formula, it does explicitly tell us what the curvature is at a given value. To maximize , we should solve for . This is doable, but very time consuming. Instead, consider the graph of as given in Figure . We see that is maximized at two values; using a numerical solver, we find these values are . In Figure we graph and indicate the points where curvature is maximized.      Curvature and Motion  Let be a position function of an object, with velocity and acceleration . In Section we established that acceleration is in the plane formed by and , and that we can find scalars and such that curvature and motion  unit tangent vector and curvature  unit normal vector and curvature  at@  an@  .   Theorem gives formulas for and : .  We understood that the amount of acceleration in the direction of relates only to how the speed of the object is changing, and that the amount of acceleration in the direction of relates to how the direction of travel of the object is changing. (That is, if the object travels at constant speed, ; if the object travels in a constant direction, .)  In Equation at the beginning of this section, we found . We can combine this fact with the above formula for to write .  Since is speed, is the rate at which speed is changing with respect to time. We see once more that the component of acceleration in the direction of travel relates only to speed, not to a change in direction.  Now compare the formula for above to the formula for curvature in Theorem : .  Thus   This last equation shows that the component of acceleration that changes the object's direction is dependent on two things: the curvature of the path and the speed of the object.  Imagine driving a car in a clockwise circle. You will naturally feel a force pushing you towards the door (more accurately, the door is pushing you as the car is turning and you want to travel in a straight line). If you keep the radius of the circle constant but speed up ( , increasing ), the door pushes harder against you ( has increased). If you keep your speed constant but tighten the turn ( , increase ), once again the door will push harder against you.  Putting our new formulas for and together, we have .  This is not a particularly practical way of finding and , but it reveals some great concepts about how acceleration interacts with speed and the shape of a curve.   Curvature and road design   The minimum radius of the curve in a highway cloverleaf is determined by the operating speed, as given in the table in Figure . For each curve and speed, compute .     Operating speed and minimum radius in highway cloverleaf design     Operating Speed (mph)  Minimum Radius (ft)    35  310    40  430    45  540     Using Equation , we can compute the acceleration normal to the curve in each case. We start by converting each speed from miles per hour to feet per second by multiplying by . . . .  Note that each acceleration is similar; this is by design. Considering the classic Force mass acceleration formula, this acceleration must be kept small in order for the tires of a vehicle to keep a grip on the road. If one travels on a turn of radius 310 at a rate of 50 , the acceleration is double, at 17.35 . If the acceleration is too high, the frictional force created by the tires may not be enough to keep the car from sliding. Civil engineers routinely compute a safe design speed, then subtract 5-10 mph to create the posted speed limit for additional safety.    We end this chapter with a reflection on what we've covered. We started with vector-valued functions, which may have seemed at the time to be just another way of writing parametric equations. However, we have seen that the vector perspective has given us great insight into the behavior of functions and the study of motion. Vector-valued position functions convey displacement, distance traveled, speed, velocity, acceleration and curvature information, each of which has great importance in science and engineering.

Civil engineers routinely compute a safe design speed, then subtract 5-10 mph to create the posted speed limit for additional safety.   "

At the time, the intent was simply to provide video content for a course: Math 2580, Calculus IV, at the University of Lethbridge. The project to create videos directly aligned to APEX Calculus came later.  As a result, the videos included here do not align perfectly with the textbook. In particular, examples done in the videos are not the same as examples done in the book.    Understanding a function of two variables   Let . Find the domain and range of .

The square root ensures that all output is . Since the and terms are squared, then subtracted, inside the square root, the largest output value comes at , : . Thus the range is the interval .      Graphing Functions of Two Variables  The graph of a function of two variables is the set of all points where is in the domain of . This creates a surface in space.   Graphing a function of two variables                       One can begin sketching a graph by plotting points, but this has limitations. Consider Figure where 25 points have been plotted of . More points have been plotted than one would reasonably want to do by hand, yet it is not clear at all what the graph of the function looks like. Technology allows us to plot lots of points, connect adjacent points with lines and add shading to create a graph like Figure which does a far better job of illustrating the behavior of .  While technology is readily available to help us graph functions of two variables, there is still a paper-and-pencil approach that is useful to understand and master as it, combined with high-quality graphics, gives one great insight into the behavior of a function. This technique is known as sketching level curves .    Level Curves  It may be surprising to find that the problem of representing a three dimensional surface on paper is familiar to most people (they just don't realize it). multivariable function level curves  level curves  contour lines Topographical maps, like the one shown in Figure , represent the surface of Earth by indicating points with the same elevation with contour lines . The elevations marked are equally spaced; in this example, each thin line indicates an elevation change in 50ft increments and each thick line indicates a change of 200ft. When lines are drawn close together, elevation changes rapidly (as one does not have to travel far to rise 50ft). When lines are far apart, such as near Aspen Campground, elevation changes more gradually as one has to walk farther to rise 50ft.    A topographical map displays elevation by drawing contour lines, along with the elevation is constant. USGS 1:24000-scale Quadrangle for Chrome Mountain, MT 1987.    Given a function , we can draw a topographical map of the graph by drawing level curves (or, contour lines). A level curve at is a curve in the -plane such that for all points on the curve, .  When drawing level curves, it is important that the values are spaced equally apart as that gives the best insight to how quickly the elevation is changing. Examples will help one understand this concept.   Drawing Level Curves   Let . Find the level curves of for , , , , and .    Consider first . The level curve for is the set of all points such that . Squaring both sides gives us , an ellipse centered at with horizontal major axis of length 6 and minor axis of length 4. Thus for any point on this curve, .  Now consider the level curve for  .  This is also an ellipse, where and .  In general, for , the level curve is: , ellipses that are decreasing in size as increases. A special case is when ; there the ellipse is just the point .  The level curves are shown in Figure . Note how the level curves for and are very, very close together: this indicates that is growing rapidly along those curves.   Graphing the level curves in Example                       In Figure , the curves are drawn on a graph of in space. Note how the elevations are evenly spaced. Near the level curves of and we can see that indeed is growing quickly.     Analyzing Level Curves   Let . Find the level curves for .    We begin by setting for an arbitrary and seeing if algebraic manipulation of the equation reveals anything significant. , a circle centered at with radius , where . The level curves for and are sketched in Figure . To help illustrate elevation, we use thicker lines for values near 0, and dashed lines indicate where .  There is one special level curve, when . The level curve in this situation is , the line .  In Figure we see a graph of the surface. Note how the -axis is pointing away from the viewer to more closely resemble the orientation of the level curves in Figure .   Graphing the level curves in Example                       Seeing the level curves helps us understand the graph. For instance, the graph does not make it clear that one can walk along the line without elevation change, though the level curve does.      Functions of Three Variables  We extend our study of multivariable functions to functions of three variables. (One can make a function of as many variables as one likes; we limit our study to three variables.)   Function of Three Variables   Let be a subset of . A function  of three variables is a rule that assigns each triple in a value in . is the domain of ; the set of all outputs of is the range . multivariable function  function of three variables  multivariable function domain  multivariable function range     Note how this definition closely resembles that of Definition .   Understanding a function of three variables   Let . Evaluate at the point and find the domain and range of .    To evaluate the function we simply set , , and in the definition of : .  As the domain of is not specified, we take it to be the set of all triples for which is defined. As we cannot divide by , we find the domain is .  We recognize that the set of all points in that are not in form a plane in space that passes through the origin (with normal vector ).  We determine the range is ; that is, all real numbers are possible outputs of . There is no set way of establishing this. Rather, to get numbers near 0 we can let and choose . To get numbers of arbitrarily large magnitude, we can let .      Level Surfaces  It is very difficult to produce a meaningful graph of a function of three variables. A function of one variable is a curve drawn in 2 dimensions; a function of two variables is a surface drawn in 3 dimensions; a function of three variables is a hypersurface drawn in 4 dimensions. multivariable function level surface  level surface   There are a few techniques one can employ to try to picture a graph of three variables. One is an analogue of level curves: level surfaces . Given , the level surface at is the surface in space formed by all points where .   Finding level surfaces   If a point source is radiating energy, the intensity at a given point in space is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between and . That is, when , for some constant .  Let ; find the level surfaces of .    We can (mostly) answer this question using common sense. If energy (say, in the form of light) is emanating from the origin, its intensity will be the same at all points equidistant from the origin. That is, at any point on the surface of a sphere centered at the origin, the intensity should be the same. Therefore, the level surfaces are spheres.  We now find this mathematically. The level surface at is defined by .  Given an intensity , the level surface is a sphere of radius , centered at the origin.   A table of values and the corresponding radius of the spheres of constant value in Example            16.  0.25    8.  0.35    4.  0.5    2.  0.71    1.  1.    0.5  1.41    0.25  2.    0.125  2.83    0.0625  4.      Figure gives a table of the radii of the spheres for given values. Normally one would use equally spaced values, but these values have been chosen purposefully. At a distance of 0.25 from the point source, the intensity is 16; to move to a point of half that intensity, one just moves out 0.1 to 0.35 not much at all. To again halve the intensity, one moves 0.15, a little more than before.  Note how each time the intensity if halved, the distance required to move away grows. We conclude that the closer one is to the source, the more rapidly the intensity changes.     In the next section we apply the concepts of limits to functions of two or more variables.     Terms and Concepts   Give two examples (other than those given in the text) of real world functions that require more than one input.   Answers will vary.    The graph of a function of two variables is a .   surface    Most people are familiar with the concept of level curves in the context of maps.   topographical    T\/F: Along a level curve, the output of a function does not change.   T    The analogue of a level curve for functions of three variables is a level .   surface    What does it mean when level curves are close together? Far apart?   When level curves are close together, it means the function is changing -values rapidly. When far apart, it changes -values slowly.     Problems    In the following exercises, give the domain and range of the multivariable function.        domain:   range:         domain:   range:         domain:   range:         domain: ; in set notation,   range:         domain:   range:         domain:   range:         domain: , , the domain is the circle and interior of a circle centered at the origin with radius 3.  range:         domain: , , the domain is the exterior of the circle (not including the circle itself) centered at the origin with radius 3.  range: , or       In the following exercises, describe in words and sketch the level curves for the function and given values.     ;    Level curves are lines .      ;    Level curves are hyperbolas , except for , where the level curve is the pair of lines , .      ;    Level curves are parabolas .      ;    Level curves are hyperbolas , drawn in graph in different styles to differentiate the curves.      ;    When , the level curves are circles, centered at with radius .

The level surfaces are paraboloids of the form ; the larger , the wider the paraboloid.        The level surfaces are planes through the origin of the form , that is, planes through the origin with normal vector .    Compare the level curves of Exercises and . How are they similar, and how are they different? Each surface is a quadric surface; describe how the level curves are consistent with what we know about each surface.   The level curves for each surface are similar; for the level curves are ellipses of the form , , and ; whereas for the level curves are ellipses of the form , , and . The first set of ellipses are spaced evenly apart, meaning the function grows at a constant rate; the second set of ellipses are more closely spaced together as grows, meaning the function grows faster and faster as increases.  The graph can be rewritten as , an elliptic cone; the graph is a paraboloid, each matching the description above.      "

  "body": " Finding level surfaces   If a point source is radiating energy, the intensity at a given point in space is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between and . That is, when , for some constant .  Let ; find the level surfaces of .    We can (mostly) answer this question using common sense. If energy (say, in the form of light) is emanating from the origin, its intensity will be the same at all points equidistant from the origin. That is, at any point on the surface of a sphere centered at the origin, the intensity should be the same. Therefore, the level surfaces are spheres.  We now find this mathematically. The level surface at is defined by .  Given an intensity , the level surface is a sphere of radius , centered at the origin.   A table of values and the corresponding radius of the spheres of constant value in Example            16.  0.25    8.  0.35    4.  0.5    2.  0.71    1.  1.    0.5  1.41    0.25  2.    0.125  2.83    0.0625  4.      Figure gives a table of the radii of the spheres for given values. Normally one would use equally spaced values, but these values have been chosen purposefully. At a distance of 0.25 from the point source, the intensity is 16; to move to a point of half that intensity, one just moves out 0.1 to 0.35 not much at all. To again halve the intensity, one moves 0.15, a little more than before.  Note how each time the intensity if halved, the distance required to move away grows. We conclude that the closer one is to the source, the more rapidly the intensity changes.    "

  "title": "Limits and Continuity of Multivariable Functions",
  "body": " Limits and Continuity of Multivariable Functions   We continue with the pattern we have established in this text: after defining a new kind of function, we apply calculus ideas to it. The previous section defined functions of two and three variables; this section investigates what it means for these functions to be continuous.   We begin with a series of definitions. We are used to open intervals such as , which represents the set of all such that , and closed intervals such as , which represents the set of all such that . We need analogous definitions for open and closed sets in the -plane.   Introducing limits and continuity for functions of several variables      Open and Closed Subsets in Higher Dimensions   Open Disk, Boundary and Interior Points, Open and Closed Sets, Bounded Sets   An open disk  in centered at with radius is the set of all points such that .  Let be a set of points in . A point in is a boundary point of if all open disks centered at contain both points in and points not in .  A point in is an interior point of if there is an open disk centered at that contains only points in .  A set is open if every point in is an interior point.  A set is closed if it contains all of its boundary points.  A set is bounded if there is an such that the open disk, centered at the origin with radius , contains . A set that is not bounded is unbounded . open  closed  open disk  closed disk  boundary point  interior point  bounded set  unbounded set      Figure shows several sets in the -plane. In each set, point lies on the boundary of the set as all open disks centered there contain both points in, and not in, the set. In contrast, point is an interior point for there is an open disk centered there that lies entirely within the set.   Illustrating open and closed sets in the -plane                                The set depicted in Figure is a closed set as it contains all of its boundary points. The set in Figure is open, for all of its points are interior points (or, equivalently, it does not contain any of its boundary points). The set in Figure is neither open nor closed as it contains some of its boundary points.   Determining open\/closed, bounded\/unbounded   Determine if the domain of the function is open, closed, or neither, and if it is bounded.    This domain of this function was found in Example to be , the region bounded by the ellipse . Since the region includes the boundary (indicated by the use of ), the set contains all of its boundary points and hence is closed. The region is bounded as a disk of radius 4, centered at the origin, contains .     Determining open\/closed, bounded\/unbounded   Determine if the domain of is open, closed, or neither.    As we cannot divide by 0, we find the domain to be . In other words, the domain is the set of all points  not on the line .   Sketching the domain of the function in Example         The domain is sketched in Figure . Note how we can draw an open disk around any point in the domain that lies entirely inside the domain, and also note how the only boundary points of the domain are the points on the line . We conclude the domain is an open set. The set is unbounded.      Limits  Recall a pseudo-definition of the limit of a function of one variable:     means that if is really close to , then is really close to . A similar pseudo-definition holds for functions of two variables. We'll say that     means if the point is really close to the point , then is really close to . The formal definition is given below.   While our first limit definition was defined over an open interval, we now define limits over a set in the plane (where does not have to be open). As planar sets can be far more complicated than intervals, our definition adds the restriction where every open disk centered at contains points in other than . In this text, all sets we'll consider will satisfy this condition and we won't bother to check; it is included in the definition for completeness.    Limit of a Function of Two Variables   Let be a set containing where every open disk centered at contains points in other than , let be a function of two variables defined on , except possibly at , and let be a real number. The limit of as approaches is , denoted , means that given any , there exists such that for all in , where , if is in the open disk centered at with radius , then . limit of multivariable function  multivariable function limit     The concept behind Definition is sketched in Figure . Given , find such that if is any point in the open disk centered at in the -plane with radius , then should be within of .  Computing limits using this definition is rather cumbersome. The following theorem allows us to evaluate limits much more easily.   Illustrating the definition of a limit. The open disk in the -plane has radius . Let be any point in this disk; is within of .          Basic Limit Properties of Functions of Two Variables   Let , , , and be real numbers, let be a positive integer, and let and be functions with the following limits: .  The following limits hold. limit of multivariable function  limit properties  multivariable function limit    Constants:     Identity ;     Sums\/Differences:     Scalar Multiples:     Products:     Quotients: , (     Powers:        This theorem, combined with Theorems and of Section , allows us to evaluate many limits.   Evaluating a limit   Evaluate the following limits:           The aforementioned theorems allow us to simply evaluate when and . If an indeterminate form is returned, we must do more work to evaluate the limit; otherwise, the result is the limit. Therefore .    We attempt to evaluate the limit by substituting 0 in for and , but the result is the indeterminate form . To evaluate this limit, we must do more work, but we have not yet learned what kind of work to do. Therefore we cannot yet evaluate this limit.       When dealing with functions of a single variable we also considered one-sided limits and stated .  That is, the limit is if and only if approaches when approaches from either direction, the left or the right.  In the plane, there are infinitely many directions from which might approach . In fact, we do not have to restrict ourselves to approaching from a particular direction, but rather we can approach that point along a path that is not a straight line. It is possible to arrive at different limiting values by approaching along different paths. If this happens, we say that does not exist (this is analogous to the left and right hand limits of single variable functions not being equal).  Our theorems tell us that we can evaluate most limits quite simply, without worrying about paths. When indeterminate forms arise, the limit may or may not exist. If it does exist, it can be difficult to prove this as we need to show the same limiting value is obtained regardless of the path chosen. The case where the limit does not exist is often easier to deal with, for we can often pick two paths along which the limit is different.   Showing limits do not exist      Show does not exist by finding the limits along the lines .    Show does not exist by finding the limit along the path .          Evaluating along the lines means replace all 's with and evaluating the resulting limit: . While the limit exists for each choice of , we get a different limit for each choice of . That is, along different lines we get differing limiting values, meaning the limit does not exist.    Let . We are to show that does not exist by finding the limit along the path . First, however, consider the limits found along the lines as done above. . By applying L'Hospital's Rule, we can show this limit is 0 except when , that is, along the line . This line is not in the domain of , so we have found the following fact: along every line in the domain of , . Now consider the limit along the path : Now apply L'Hospital's Rule twice: . This last limit is of the form , which suggests that the limit does not exist. Step back and consider what we have just discovered. Along any line in the domain of the , the limit is 0. However, along the path , which lies in the domain of for all , the limit does not exist. Since the limit is not the same along every path to , we say does not exist.        Finding a limit   Let . Find .    It is relatively easy to show that along any line , the limit is 0. This is not enough to prove that the limit exists, as demonstrated in the previous example, but it tells us that if the limit does exist then it must be 0.  To prove the limit is 0, we apply Definition . Let be given. We want to find such that if , then .  Set . Note that for all , and that if , then .  Let . Consider : .  Thus if then , which is what we wanted to show. Thus .      Continuity   Definition defines what it means for a function of one variable to be continuous. In brief, it meant that the graph of the function did not have breaks, holes, jumps, etc. We define continuity for functions of two variables in a similar way as we did for functions of one variable.   Continuous   Let a function be defined on a set containing the point .      is continuous at if . continuous function  multivariable function continuity      is continuous on if is continuous at all points in . If is continuous at all points in , we say that is continuous everywhere .        Continuity of a function of two variables   Let . Is continuous at ? Is continuous everywhere?    To determine if is continuous at , we need to compare to .  Applying the definition of , we see that .  We now consider the limit . Substituting for and in returns the indeterminate form 0\/0 , so we need to do more work to evaluate this limit.  Consider two related limits: and . The first limit does not contain , and since is continuous, .  The second limit does not contain . By Theorem we can say .  Finally, Theorem of this section states that we can combine these two limits as follows: .  We have found that , so is continuous at .  A similar analysis shows that is continuous at all points in . As long as , we can evaluate the limit directly; when , a similar analysis shows that the limit is . Thus we can say that is continuous everywhere. A graph of is given in Figure . Notice how it has no breaks, jumps, etc.   A graph of in Example           The following theorem is very similar to Theorem , giving us ways to combine continuous functions to create other continuous functions.   Properties of Continuous Functions   Let and be continuous on a set , let be a real number, and let be a positive integer. The following functions are continuous on . continuous function properties  multivariable function continuity    Sums\/Differences:     Constant Multiples:     Products:     Quotients: { (as longs as on )}    Powers:     Roots: (if is even then on ; if is odd, then true for all values of on .)    Compositions:Adjust the definitions of and to: Let be continuous on , where the range of on is , and let be a single variable function that is continuous on . Then , , , is continuous on .        Establishing continuity of a function   Let . Show is continuous everywhere.    We will apply both Theorems and . Let . Since is not actually used in the function, and polynomials are continuous (by Theorem ), we conclude is continuous everywhere. A similar statement can be made about . Part 3 of Theorem states that is continuous everywhere, and Part 7 of the theorem states the composition of sine with is continuous: that is, is continuous everywhere.      Functions of Three Variables  The definitions and theorems given in this section can be extended in a natural way to definitions and theorems about functions of three (or more) variables. We cover the key concepts here; some terms from Definitions and are not redefined but their analogous meanings should be clear to the reader.   Open Balls, Limit, Continuous      An open ball in centered at with radius is the set of all points such that . multivariable function limit  limit of multivariable function  multivariable function continuity  open ball     Let be a set in containing where every open ball centered at contains points of other than , and let be a function of three variables defined on , except possibly at . The limit of as approaches is , denoted , means that given any , there is a such that for all in , , if is in the open ball centered at with radius , then .    Let be defined on a set containing . We say is continuous at if . If is continuous at all points in , we say is continuous on .       These definitions can also be extended naturally to apply to functions of four or more variables. Theorem also applies to function of three or more variables, allowing us to say that the function is continuous everywhere.  When considering single variable functions, we studied limits, then continuity, then the derivative. In our current study of multivariable functions, we have studied limits and continuity. In the next section we study derivation, which takes on a slight twist as we are in a multivariable context.

We can take the derivative of with respect to along this curve and find equations of tangent lines, etc.   By fixing , the surface is a curve in space                       The key notion to extract from this example is: by treating as constant (it does not vary) we can consider how changes with respect to . In a similar fashion, we can hold constant and consider how changes with respect to . This is the underlying principle of partial derivatives . We state the formal, limit-based definition first, then show how to compute these partial derivatives without directly taking limits.   Partial Derivative   Let be a continuous function on a set in .     The partial derivative of with respect to is: .    The partial derivative of with respect to is: .      partial derivative  derivative partial      Alternate notations for include: , with similar notations for . For ease of notation, is often abbreviated .    Computing partial derivatives with the limit definition   Let . Find using the limit definition.    Using Definition , we have: .  We have found .     Example found a partial derivative using the formal, limit-based definition. Using limits is not necessary, though, as we can rely on our previous knowledge of derivatives to compute partial derivatives easily. When computing , we hold fixed it does not vary. Therefore we can compute the derivative with respect to by treating as a constant or coefficient.  Just as , we compute . Here we are treating as a coefficient.  Just as , we compute . Here we are treating as a constant. More examples will help make this clear.   Finding partial derivatives   Find and in each of the following.              We have . Begin with . Keep fixed, treating it as a constant or coefficient, as appropriate: . Note how the and terms go to zero. To compute , we hold fixed: . Note how the and terms go to zero.    We have . Begin with . We need to apply the Chain Rule with the cosine term; is the coefficient of the -term inside the cosine function. . To find , note that is the coefficient of the term inside of the cosine term; also note that since is fixed, is also fixed, and we treat it as a constant. .    We have . Beginning with , note how we need to apply the Product Rule. . Note that when finding we do not have to apply the Product Rule; since does not contain , we treat it as fixed and hence becomes a coefficient of the term. .        Additional partial derivative computation examples    We have shown how to compute a partial derivative, but it may still not be clear what a partial derivative means . Given , measures the rate at which changes as only varies: is held constant. partial derivative meaning   Imagine standing in a rolling meadow, then beginning to walk due east. Depending on your location, you might walk up, sharply down, or perhaps not change elevation at all. This is similar to measuring : you are moving only east (in the -direction) and not north\/south at all. Going back to your original location, imagine now walking due north (in the -direction). Perhaps walking due north does not change your elevation at all. This is analogous to : does not change with respect to . We can see that and do not have to be the same, or even similar, as it is easy to imagine circumstances where walking east means you walk downhill, though walking north makes you walk uphill.   Interpreting partial derivatives    The following example helps us visualize this more.   Evaluating partial derivatives   Let . Find and and interpret their meaning.    We begin by computing and . Thus .  It is also useful to note that . What does each of these numbers mean?  Consider , along with Figure . If one stands on the surface at the point and moves parallel to the -axis ( , only the -value changes, not the -value), then the instantaneous rate of change is . Increasing the -value will decrease the -value; decreasing the -value will increase the -value.   Illustrating the meaning of partial derivatives                       Now consider , illustrated in Figure . Moving along the curve drawn on the surface, , parallel to the -axis and not changing the -values, increases the -value instantaneously at a rate of 1. Increasing the -value by 1 would increase the -value by approximately 1.  Since the magnitude of is greater than the magnitude of at , it is steeper in the -direction than in the -direction.      Tangent Planes  Another way to interpret partial derivatives is in terms of the tangent plane . Consider the graph of a function , such as the one in Figure . Setting , defines a point on the graph. Through the point , we have the lines , and , parallel to the and axes, respectively (where are parameters).  Using the function we define two vector-valued functions: . Both vector-valued functions define space curves that lie on the surface , and these curves intersect at the point , when .  Now consider computing . The first two components of this derivative are found in a straightforward manner: they are and , respectively. To find the third component of the derivative, notice that in we vary the -component of while holding the -component constant. Using the Chain Rule and Definition , we find that the third component is . Altogether, we have . Evaluating this at gives . We can perform a similar process with , ultimately leading to . From Section , we know that defines a tangent vector to the curve when , and similarly, defines a tangent vector to the curve when .  It seems reasonable that any vector that is tangent to these curves, which lie on our surface, should also be considered tangent to that surface. The vectors and are therefore tangent to at , and they are definitely not parallel. From Section we know that any two non-parallel vectors at a point define a plane through that point. We also know that taking the cross product of these two vectors gives us a normal vector: the cross product gives us .  The equation of the plane through with normal vector is . It is customary to solve for in this equation and make the following definition.    Let be a function whose first-order partial derivatives exist at . The tangent plane to the surface at the point is the plane defined by the equation . tangent plane  tangent plane to a graph      Finding a tangent plane equation   Find the equation of tangent plane to the surface at .    Our function is , and we have , so the point on the surface is . The partial derivatives are and , so , . Using , our plane is given by .    Notice the similarity between the tangent plane equation in and the single variable tangent line equation . As with functions of one variable, this suggests a connection between derivatives and linear approximation. We explore this connection in , where we'll see that should be strengthed to require that the partial derivatives of be continuous .    Second-order partial derivatives  Let . We have learned to find the partial derivatives and , which are each functions of and . Therefore we can take partial derivatives of them, each with respect to and . We define these second partials along with the notation, give examples, then discuss their meaning.   Second Partial Derivative, Mixed Partial Derivative   Let be continuous on a set .     The second partial derivative of with respect to then is     The second partial derivative of with respect to then is      Similar definitions hold for and .  The second partial derivatives and are mixed partial derivatives . partial derivative mixed  partial derivative second derivative  derivative mixed partial     The notation of second partial derivatives gives some insight into the notation of the second derivative of a function of a single variable. If , then . The portion means take the derivative of twice, while means with respect to both times. When we only know of functions of a single variable, this latter phrase seems silly: there is only one variable to take the derivative with respect to. Now that we understand functions of multiple variables, we see the importance of specifying which variables we are referring to.   The terms in Definition all depend on limits, so each definition comes with the caveat where the limit exists.     Second partial derivatives   For each of the following, find all six first and second partial derivatives. That is, find .           In each, we give and immediately and then spend time deriving the second partial derivatives.                Because the following partial derivatives get rather long, we omit the extra notation and just give the results. In several cases, multiple applications of the Product and Chain Rules will be necessary, followed by some basic combination of like terms.         Second order partial derivatives and differentiability classes    Notice how in each of the three functions in Example , . Due to the complexity of the examples, this likely is not a coincidence. The following theorem states that it is not.   Mixed Partial Derivatives   Let be defined such that and are continuous on a set . Then for each point in , .    Finding and independently and comparing the results provides a convenient way of checking our work.    Understanding Second Partial Derivatives  Now that we know how to find second partials, we investigate what they tell us.  Again we refer back to a function of a single variable. The second derivative of is the derivative of the derivative, or the rate of change of the rate of change. The second derivative measures how much the derivative is changing. If , then the derivative is getting smaller (so the graph of is concave down); if , then the derivative is growing, making the graph of concave up.  Now consider . Similar statements can be made about and as could be made about above. When taking derivatives with respect to twice, we measure how much changes with respect to . If , it means that as increases, decreases, and the graph of will be concave down in the -direction . Using the analogy of standing in the rolling meadow used earlier in this section, measures whether one's path is concave up\/down when walking due east.  Similarly, measures the concavity in the -direction. If , then is increasing with respect to and the graph of will be concave up in the -direction. Appealing to the rolling meadow analogy again, measures whether one's path is concave up\/down when walking due north.  We now consider the mixed partials and . The mixed partial measures how much changes with respect to . Once again using the rolling meadow analogy, measures the slope if one walks due east. Looking east, begin walking north (side-stepping). Is the path towards the east getting steeper? If so, . Is the path towards the east not changing in steepness? If so, then . A similar thing can be said about : consider the steepness of paths heading north while side-stepping to the east.  The following example examines these ideas with concrete numbers and graphs.   Understanding second partial derivatives   Let . Evaluate the 6 first and second partial derivatives at and interpret what each of these numbers mean.    We find that:   , , , and . Thus at we have .  The slope of the tangent line at in the direction of is : if one moves from that point parallel to the -axis, the instantaneous rate of change will be . The slope of the tangent line at this point in the direction of is : if one moves from this point parallel to the -axis, the instantaneous rate of change will be . These tangents lines are graphed in Figure and Figure , respectively, where the tangent lines are drawn in a solid line.   Understanding the second partial derivatives in Example                       Now consider only Figure . Three directed tangent lines are drawn (two are dashed), each in the direction of ; that is, each has a slope determined by . Note how as increases, the slope of these lines get closer to . Since the slopes are all negative, getting closer to 0 means the slopes are increasing. The slopes given by are increasing as increases, meaning must be positive.  Since , we also expect to increase as increases. Consider Figure where again three directed tangent lines are drawn, this time each in the direction of with slopes determined by . As increases, the slopes become less steep (closer to 0). Since these are negative slopes, this means the slopes are increasing.  Thus far we have a visual understanding of , , and . We now interpret and . In Figure , we see a curve drawn where is held constant at : only varies. This curve is clearly concave down, corresponding to the fact that . In part Figure of the figure, we see a similar curve where is constant and only varies. This curve is concave up, corresponding to the fact that .      Partial Derivatives and Functions of Three Variables  The concepts underlying partial derivatives can be easily extend to more than two variables. We give some definitions and examples in the case of three variables and trust the reader can extend these definitions to more variables if needed.   Partial Derivatives with Three Variables   Let be a continuous function on a set in .  The partial derivative of with respect to is: .  Similar definitions hold for and . derivative partial  partial derivative     By taking partial derivatives of partial derivatives, we can find second partial derivatives of with respect to then , for instance, just as before.   Partial derivatives of functions of three variables   For each of the following, find ,  ,  ,  ,  , and .                   ; ; , and          Higher Order Partial Derivatives  We can continue taking partial derivatives of partial derivatives of partial derivatives of ; we do not have to stop with second partial derivatives. These higher order partial derivatives do not have a tidy graphical interpretation; nevertheless they are not hard to compute and worthy of some practice. partial derivative high order   We do not formally define each higher order derivative, but rather give just a few examples of the notation. .   Higher order partial derivatives      Let . Find and .    Let . Find .          To find , we first find , then , then : . To find , we first find , then , then : . Note how .    To find , we find , then , then : .       In the previous example we saw that ; this is not a coincidence. While we do not state this as a formal theorem, as long as each partial derivative is continuous, it does not matter the order in which the partial derivatives are taken. For instance, .  This can be useful at times. Had we known this, the second part of Example would have been much simpler to compute. Instead of computing in the , then orders, we could have applied the , then then order (as ). It is easy to see that ; then and are clearly 0 as does not contain an or .  A brief review of this section: partial derivatives measure the instantaneous rate of change of a multivariable function with respect to one variable. With , the partial derivatives and measure the instantaneous rate of change of when moving parallel to the - and -axes, respectively. How do we measure the rate of change at a point when we do not move parallel to one of these axes? What if we move in the direction given by the vector ? Can we measure that rate of change? The answer is, of course, yes, we can. This is the topic of Section . First, we need to define what it means for a function of two variables to be differentiable.      Terms and Concepts   What is the difference between a constant and a coefficient?   A constant is a number that is added or subtracted in an expression; a coefficient is a number that is being multiplied by a nonconstant function.    Given a function , explain in your own words how to compute .   Answers will vary; each should include something about treating as a constant or a coefficient.

  "title": "Differentiability and the Total Differential",
  "body": " Differentiability and the Total Differential   We studied differentials in Section , where Definition states that if and is differentiable, then . One important use of this differential is in Integration by Substitution. Another important application is approximation. Let represent a change in . When is small, , the change in resulting from the change in . Fundamental in this understanding is this: as gets small, the difference between and goes to 0. Another way of stating this: as goes to 0, the error in approximating with goes to 0.  We extend this idea to functions of two variables. Let , and let and represent changes in and , respectively. Let be the change in over the change in and . Recalling that and give the instantaneous rates of -change in the - and -directions, respectively, we can approximate with ; in words, the total change in is approximately the change caused by changing plus the change caused by changing . In a moment we give an indication of whether or not this approximation is any good. First we give a name to .    The Total Differential   Total Differential   Let be continuous on a set . Let and represent changes in and , respectively. Where the partial derivatives and exist, the total differential of is total differential  partial derivative total differential  .     From Definition , we can write .  While not explored in this section, the vector is seen again in the next section and fully defined in Section .    Finding the total differential   Let . Find .    We compute the partial derivatives: and . Following Definition , we have .    We can approximate with , but as with all approximations, there is error involved. A good approximation is one in which the error is small. At a given point , let and be functions of and such that describes this error. Then .  If the approximation of by is good, then as and get small, so does . The approximation of by is even better if, as and go to 0, so do and . This leads us to our definition of differentiability.   Multivariable Differentiability   Let be defined on a set containing where and exist. Let be the total differential of at , let , and let and be functions of and such that .     We say is differentiable at if, given , there is a such that if , then . That is, as and go to 0, so do and .    We say is differentiable on if is differentiable at every point in . If is differentiable on , we say that is differentiable everywhere . differentiable  derivative multivariable differentiability  multivariable function differentiability         Another approach to defining differentiability     Showing a function is differentiable   Show is differentiable using Definition .    We begin by finding , , and . .   , so .  It is straightforward to compute and . Consider once more : .  With and , it is clear that as and go to 0, and also go to 0. Since this did not depend on a specific point , we can say that is differentiable for all pairs in , or, equivalently, that is differentiable everywhere.     Establishing differentiability using the definition in    Our intuitive understanding of differentiability of functions of one variable was that the graph of was smooth. A similar intuitive understanding of functions of two variables is that the surface defined by is also smooth, not containing cusps, edges, breaks, etc. The following theorem states that differentiable functions are continuous, followed by another theorem that provides a more tangible way of determining whether a great number of functions are differentiable or not.   Continuity and Differentiability of Multivariable Functions   Let be defined on a set containing . If is differentiable at , then is continuous at . multivariable function differentiability  multivariable function continuity      Differentiability of Multivariable Functions   Let be defined on a set . If and are both continuous on , then is differentiable on . multivariable function differentiability     The theorems assure us that essentially all functions that we see in the course of our studies here are differentiable (and hence continuous) on their natural domains. There is a difference between Definition and Theorem , though: it is possible for a function to be differentiable yet and\/or is not continuous. Such strange behavior of functions is a source of delight for many mathematicians.  When and exist at a point but are not continuous at that point, we need to use other methods to determine whether or not is differentiable at that point.  For instance, consider the function .  We can find and using Definition : .  Both and  exist at , but they are not continuous at , as are not continuous at . (Take the limit of as along the - and -axes; they give different results.) So even though and  exist at every point in the -plane, they are not continuous. Therefore it is possible, by Theorem , for to not be differentiable.  Indeed, it is not. One can show that is not continuous at (see Example ), and by Theorem , this means is not differentiable at .    Approximating with the Total Differential  By the definition, when is differentiable is a good approximation for when and are small. We give some simple examples of how this is used here.   Approximating with the total differential   Let . Approximate .    Recognizing that , we can approximate using . We can easily compute . Without calculus, this is the best approximation we could reasonably come up with. The total differential gives us a way of adjusting this initial approximation to hopefully get a more accurate answer.  We let . The total differential is approximately equal to , so .  To find , we need and . .  Approximating with 4 gives ; approximating with gives . Thus .  Returning to Equation , we have .  We, of course, can compute the actual value of with a calculator; the actual value, accurate to 5 places after the decimal, is . Obviously our approximation is quite good.    The point of the previous example was not to develop an approximation method for known functions. After all, we can very easily compute using readily available technology. Rather, it serves to illustrate how well this method of approximation works, and to reinforce the following concept:   New position = old position amount of change, so   New position old position + approximate amount of change.   In the previous example, we could easily compute and could approximate the amount of -change when computing , letting us approximate the new -value.  It may be surprising to learn that it is not uncommon to know the values of , and at a particular point without actually knowing the function . The total differential gives a good method of approximating at nearby points.   Approximating an unknown function   Given that , and , approximate .    The total differential approximates how much changes from the point to the point . With and , we have .  The change in is approximately , so we approximate .      Tangent Plane Approximation  Recall from Chapter that in one variable, the essence of differentiability is the tangent line approximation. This idea is emphasized in Section , where we first introduced the differential.  In Section we saw that the partial derivatives of a function can be used to define the tangent plane to a graph . We will now see that this plane plays the same role for functions of two variables as the tangent line to a graph for a function of one variable.  Recall from Definition that for a function , when is near we have the linear approximation , where is the linearization of at . If we set , and evaluate the differential at , then we have .  Given the graph , we know that gives the tangent line to the graph at . For the graph of a function of two variables, we similarly have the tangent plane defined in , suggesting that we define the two variable linearization .  Consider the total differential at : . If we assume that is close to , and set , , then we have . Since , we have , which agrees with the one-variable situation, and reinforces the concept of the differential as the linear change in a function.  If we recast in the language of tangent planes, we can more easily see the analogy with functions of a single variable. We can now say that is differentiable at if it has a valid tangent plane approximation at . Note that is equal to the error term .  By , we know that the tangent plane at exists, and gives a good approximation to the graph , as long as the partial derivatives of exist and are continuous at .    Error\/Sensitivity Analysis  The total differential gives an approximation of the change in given small changes in and . We can use this to approximate error propagation; that is, if the input is a little off from what it should be, how far from correct will the output be? We demonstrate this in an example.   sensitivity analysis  total differential sensitivity analysis    Sensitivity analysis   A cylindrical steel storage tank is to be built that is 10ft tall and 4ft across in diameter. It is known that the steel will expand\/contract with temperature changes; is the overall volume of the tank more sensitive to changes in the diameter or in the height of the tank?    A cylindrical solid with height and radius has volume . We can view as a function of two variables, and . We can compute partial derivatives of : .  The total differential is . When and , we have . Note that the coefficient of is ; the coefficient of is a tenth of that, approximately . A small change in radius will be multiplied by 125.7, whereas a small change in height will be multiplied by 12.57. Thus the volume of the tank is more sensitive to changes in radius than in height.    The previous example showed that the volume of a particular tank was more sensitive to changes in radius than in height. Keep in mind that this analysis only applies to a tank of those dimensions. A tank with a height of 1ft and radius of 5ft would be more sensitive to changes in height than in radius.  One could make a chart of small changes in radius and height and find exact changes in volume given specific changes. While this provides exact numbers, it does not give as much insight as the error analysis using the total differential.    Differentiability of Functions of Three Variables  The definition of differentiability for functions of three variables is very similar to that of functions of two variables. We again start with the total differential.   Total Differential   Let be continuous on a set . Let , and represent changes in , and , respectively. Where the partial derivatives , and exist, the total differential of is total differential  partial derivative total differential  .    This differential can be a good approximation of the change in when is differentiable .   Multivariable Differentiability   Let be defined on a set containing where , and exist. Let be the total differential of at , let , and let , and be functions of , and such that differentiable  derivative multivariable differentiability  multivariable function differentiability  .     We say is differentiable at if, given , there is a such that if , then .    We say is differentiable on if is differentiable at every point in . If is differentiable on , we say that is differentiable everywhere .       Just as before, this definition gives a rigorous statement about what it means to be differentiable that is not very intuitive. We follow it with a theorem similar to Theorem .   Continuity and Differentiability of Functions of Three Variables   Let be defined on a set containing .     If is differentiable at , then is continuous at .    If , and are continuous on , then is differentiable on . multivariable function differentiability  multivariable function continuity        This set of definition and theorem extends to functions of any number of variables. The theorem again gives us a simple way of verifying that most functions that we encounter are differentiable on their natural domains.  This section has given us a formal definition of what it means for a functions to be differentiable, along with a theorem that gives a more accessible understanding. The following sections return to notions prompted by our study of partial derivatives that make use of the fact that most functions we encounter are differentiable.     Terms and Concepts   T\/F: If is differentiable on , the is continuous on .   T    T\/F: If and are continuous on , then is differentiable on .   T    T\/F: If is differentiable, then the change in over small changes and in and is approximately .   T    Finish the sentence: The new -value is approximately the old -value plus the approximate .    amount of change     Problems    In the following exercises, find the total differential .                                          In the following exercises, a function is given. Give the indicated approximation using the total differential.     . Approximate knowing .    , with and . At , , so .     . Approximate knowing .    , with and . At , , so .     . Approximate knowing .    , with and . At , , so .     . Approximate knowing .    , with and . At , , so .      The following exercises ask a variety of questions dealing with approximating error and sensitivity analysis.    A cylindrical storage tank is to be 2ft tall with a radius of 1ft. Is the volume of the tank more sensitive to changes in the radius or the height?   The total differential of volume is . The coefficient of is greater than the coefficient of , so the volume is more sensitive to changes in the radius.     Projectile Motion: The -value of an object moving under the principles of projectile motion is . A particular projectile is fired with an initial velocity of ft\/s and an angle of elevation of . It travels a distance of ft in 3 seconds.  Is the projectile more sensitive to errors in initial speed or angle of elevation?   Distance of the projectile is a function of two variables (leaving ): . The total differential of is . The coefficient of has a much greater magnitude than the coefficient of , so a small change in the angle of elevation has a much greater effect on distance traveled than a small change in initial velocity.    The length of a long wall is to be approximated. The angle , as shown in the diagram (not to scale), is measured to be , and the distance is measured to be 30'. Assume that the triangle formed is a right triangle.  Is the measurement of the length of more sensitive to errors in the measurement of or in ?       Using trigonometry, , so . With and , we have . The measured length of the wall is much more sensitive to errors in than in . While it can be difficult to compare sensitivities between measuring feet and measuring degrees (it is somewhat like comparing apples to oranges ), here the coefficients are so different that the result is clear: a small error in degree has a much greater impact than a small error in distance.    It is common sense that it is far better to measure a long distance with a long measuring tape rather than a short one. A measured distance can be viewed as the product of the length of a measuring tape times the number of times it was used. For instance, using a 3' tape 10 times gives a length of 30'. To measure the same distance with a 12' tape, we would use the tape 2.5 times. ( , .) Thus .  Suppose each time a measurement is taken with the tape, the recorded distance is within 1\/16'' of the actual distance. ( , ft). Using differentials, show why common sense proves correct in that it is better to use a long tape to measure long distances.   With , the total differential is . If one measures with a short tape, must be large and hence is going to be greater than when a large tape is used (wherein will be small).      In the following exercises, find the total differential .                        In the following exercises, use the information provided and the total differential to make the given approximation.     ,  , . Approximate .    , . . So .     ,  , . Approximate .    , . .

  "title": "The Multivariable Chain Rule",
  "body": " The Multivariable Chain Rule   Consider driving an off-road vehicle along a dirt road. As you drive, your elevation likely changes. What factors determine how quickly your elevation rises and falls? After some thought, generally one recognizes that one's velocity (speed and direction) and the terrain influence your rise and fall.  One can represent the terrain as the surface defined by a multivariable function ; one can represent the path of the off-road vehicle, as seen from above, with a vector-valued function ; the velocity of the vehicle is thus .  Consider Figure in which a surface is drawn, along with a dashed curve in the -plane. Restricting to just the points on this circle gives the curve shown on the surface ( , the path of the off-road vehicle. ) The derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to . If we consider an object traveling along this path, gives the rate at which the object rises\/falls ( , the rate of elevation change of the vehicle.) Conceptually, the Multivariable Chain Rule combines terrain and velocity information properly to compute this rate of elevation change.   Understanding the application of the Multivariable Chain Rule         Abstractly, let be a function of and ; that is, for some function , and let and each be functions of . By choosing a -value, - and -values are determined, which in turn determine : this defines as a function of . The Multivariable Chain Rule gives a method of computing .   Introducing the chain rule in several variables      Multivariable Chain Rule, Part I   Multivariable Chain Rule, Part I   Let , and , where , and are differentiable functions. Then is a function of , and derivative Chain Rule  Chain Rule multivariable  .    The Chain Rule of Section states that . If , we can express the Chain Rule as recall that the derivative notation is deliberately chosen to reflect their fraction-like properties. A similar effect is seen in Theorem . In the second line of equations, one can think of the and as sort of canceling out, and likewise with and .  Notice, too, the third line of equations in Theorem . The vector contains information about the surface (terrain); the vector can represent velocity. In the context measuring the rate of elevation change of the off-road vehicle, the Multivariable Chain Rule states it can be found through a product of terrain and velocity information.  We now practice applying the Multivariable Chain Rule.   Examples involving the chain rule     Using the Multivariable Chain Rule   Let , where and . Find using the Chain Rule.    Following Theorem , we find .  Applying the theorem, we have .  This may look odd, as it seems that is a function of , and . Since and are functions of , is really just a function of , and we can replace with and with : .    The previous example can make us wonder: if we substituted for and at the end to show that is really just a function of , why not substitute before differentiating, showing clearly that is a function of ?  That is, . Applying the Chain and Product Rules, we have , which matches the result from the example.  This may now make one wonder What's the point? If we could already find the derivative, why learn another way of finding it? In some cases, applying this rule makes deriving simpler, but this is hardly the power of the Chain Rule. Rather, in the case where , and , the Chain Rule is extremely powerful when we do not know what , and\/or are . It may be hard to believe, but often in the real world we know rate-of-change information ( , information about derivatives) without explicitly knowing the underlying functions. The Chain Rule allows us to combine several rates of change to find another rate of change. The Chain Rule also has theoretic use, giving us insight into the behavior of certain constructions (as we'll see in the next section).  We demonstrate this in the next example.   Applying the Multivariable Chain Rule   An object travels along a path on a surface. The exact path and surface are not known, but at time it is known that : .  Find at time .    The Multivariable Chain Rule states that .  By knowing certain rates-of-change information about the surface and about the path of the particle in the -plane, we can determine how quickly the object is rising\/falling.    We next apply the Chain Rule to solve a max\/min problem.   Applying the Multivariable Chain Rule   Consider the surface , a paraboloid, on which a particle moves with and coordinates given by and . Find when , and find where the particle reaches its maximum\/minimum -values.    It is straightforward to compute .  Combining these according to the Chain Rule gives: .   Plotting the path of a particle on a surface in Example         When , and . Thus . When , the particle is moving down, as shown in Figure .  To find where -value is maximized\/minimized on the particle's path, we set and solve for :   We can use the First Derivative Test to find that on , has reaches its absolute minimum at and ; it reaches its absolute maximum at and , as shown in Figure .    We can extend the Chain Rule to include the situation where is a function of more than one variable, and each of these variables is also a function of more than one variable. The basic case of this is where , and and are functions of two variables, say and .   Multivariable Chain Rule, Part II      Let , and , where , and are differentiable functions. Then is a function of and , and       derivative Chain Rule  Chain Rule multivariable     Let be a differentiable function of variables, where each of the is a differentiable function of the variables . Then is a function of the , and .        Using the Multivariable Chain Rule, Part II   Let , and . Find and , and evaluate each when and .    Following Theorem , we compute the following partial derivatives: , .  Thus  .  When and , and , so .     Using the Multivariable Chain Rule, Part II   Let , where , , and . Find when and .    Following Theorem , we compute the following partial derivatives: .  Thus .  When and , we have , and . Thus .       Implicit Differentiation  We studied finding when is given as an implicit function of in detail in Section . We find here that the Multivariable Chain Rule gives a simpler method of finding .  For instance, consider the implicit function . We learned to use the following steps to find : .  Instead of using this method, consider . The implicit function above describes the level curve . Considering and as functions of , the Multivariable Chain Rule states that .  Since is constant (in our example, ), . We also know . Equation becomes .  Note how our solution for in Equation is just the partial derivative of with respect to , divided by the partial derivative of with respect to , all multiplied by .  We state the above as a theorem.   Implicit Differentiation   Let be a differentiable function of and , where defines as an implicit function of , for some constant . Then derivative implicit  implicit differentiation  .    We practice using Theorem by applying it to a problem from Section .   Implicit Differentiation   Given the implicitly defined function , find . Note: this is the same problem as given in Example of Section , where the solution took about a full page to find.    Let ; the implicitly defined function above is equivalent to . We find by applying Theorem . We find , so , which matches our solution from Example .     Examples with implicit differentiation    We can also do implicit differentiation for functions of three variables. In the same way that a level curve is used to implicitly define as a function of , a level surface can be viewed as implicitly defining as a function of and .  Suppose the equation , where is a constant, defines the function . Then we can use the chain rule to compute the derivatives of with respect to and , where we set , , and . Since is constant, we have . Solving for gives us , and similarly, .   There is a subtlety in this calculation that can be quite confusing. It appears to be chain rule, but shouldn't the derivative of with respect to be simply ? The catch here is that we are considering the variables (viewed as coordinates in ) as functions of and , viewed as coordinates in .  In other words, the and in are not the same as the ones in ! If this is still confusing, try setting , , and , and then applying the chain rule as usual, for derivatives of with respect to and . At the end, we can relabel and as and .   In we saw that we can use partial derivatives to determine the equation of the tangent plane to a graph . Using implicit differentiation, we can do the same for a level surface .   Implicit Differentiation with three variables   Given that the equation defines implicitly as a function of and , compute and using implicit differentiation. Then, determine the equation of the tangent plane to the surface at the point .    There are two ways to proceed. One is to use implicit differentiation as before, but using partial derivatives. Whenever we differentiate a function of , we multiply by the appropriate partial derivative of . The other option is to use the formula derived above. We will use the first method for the derivative, and the second for .  We first take the partial derivative of both sides of with respect to : . Note that we treated as a constant, since the derivative is with respect to . Next, we collect terms: . Lastly, we solve for : .  For the derivative, we will use the result given above. Setting , we have . Therefore, . The second method certainly seems simpler! The reader is invited to try each part with the other method, and compare answers.  Finally, we consider the problem of the tangent plane. First, we check that the point is indeed on the surface: , as required. Next we note that is given to us from this point. So if implicitly defines the graph , then we must have . Next, we have . The equation of the tangent plane is therefore .    In Section we learned how partial derivatives give certain instantaneous rate of change information about a function . In that section, we measured the rate of change of by holding one variable constant and letting the other vary (such as, holding constant and letting vary gives ). We can visualize this change by considering the surface defined by at a point and moving parallel to the -axis.  What if we want to move in a direction that is not parallel to a coordinate axis? Can we still measure instantaneous rates of change? Yes; we find out how in Section . In doing so, we'll see how the Multivariable Chain Rule informs our understanding of these directional derivatives .     Terms and Concepts   Let a level curve of be described by , . Explain why .   Because the parametric equations describe a level curve, is constant for all . Therefore .    Fill in the blank: The single variable Chain Rule states .        Fill in the blank: The Multivariable Chain Rule states     .    , and     If , where and , we can substitute and write as an explicit function of .  T\/F: Using the Multivariable Chain Rule to find is sometimes easier than first substituting and then taking the derivative.   T    T\/F: The Multivariable Chain Rule is only useful when all the related functions are known explicitly.   F     The Multivariable Chain Rule allows us to compute implicit derivatives easily by just computing two derivatives.

  "body": " Directional Derivatives   Partial derivatives give us an understanding of how a surface changes when we move in the and directions. We made the comparison to standing in a rolling meadow and heading due east: the amount of rise\/fall in doing so is comparable to . Likewise, the rise\/fall in moving due north is comparable to . The steeper the slope, the greater in magnitude .  But what if we didn't move due north or east? What if we needed to move northeast and wanted to measure the amount of rise\/fall? Partial derivatives alone cannot measure this. This section investigates directional derivatives , which do measure this rate of change.   Introducing directional derivatives      Functions of Two Variables  We begin with a definition.   Directional Derivatives   Let be continuous on a set and let be a unit vector. For all points , the directional derivative of at in the direction of is derivative directional  directional derivative  .    The partial derivatives and are defined with similar limits, but only or varies with , not both. Here both and vary with a weighted , determined by a particular unit vector . This may look a bit intimidating but in reality it is not too difficult to deal with; it often just requires extra algebra. However, the following theorem reduces this algebraic load.   Directional Derivatives   Let be differentiable on a set containing , and let be a unit vector. The directional derivative of at in the direction of is derivative directional  directional derivative  .     Computing directional derivatives   Let and let . Find the directional derivative of , at , in the following directions:     toward the point ,    in the direction of , and    toward the origin.       The surface is plotted in Figure , where the point is indicated in the -plane as well as the point which lies on the surface of . We find that and ; and .   Understanding the directional derivative in Example            Let be the unit vector that points from the point to the point , as shown in the figure. The vector ; the unit vector in this direction is . Thus the directional derivative of at in the direction of is . Thus the instantaneous rate of change in moving from the point on the surface in the direction of (which points toward the point ) is about . Moving in this direction moves one steeply downward.    We seek the directional derivative in the direction of . The unit vector in this direction is . Thus the directional derivative of at in the direction of is . Starting on the surface of at and moving in the direction of (or ) results in no instantaneous change in -value. This is analogous to standing on the side of a hill and choosing a direction to walk that does not change the elevation. One neither walks up nor down, rather just along the side of the hill. Finding these directions of no elevation change is important.    At , the direction towards the origin is given by the vector ; the unit vector in this direction is . The directional derivative of at in the direction of the origin is . Moving towards the origin means walking uphill quite steeply, with an initial slope of about .        Computing directional derivatives    As we study directional derivatives, it will help to make an important connection between the unit vector that describes the direction and the partial derivatives and . We start with a definition and follow this with a Key Idea.   Gradient   Let be differentiable on a set that contains the point . gradient    The gradient of is .    The gradient of at is .         The symbol is named nabla, derived from the Greek name of a Jewish harp. Oddly enough, in mathematics the expression is pronounced del .    To simplify notation, we often express the gradient as . The gradient allows us to compute directional derivatives in terms of a dot product.   The Gradient and Directional Derivatives  The directional derivative of in the direction of is gradient  directional derivative  derivative directional  .   The properties of the dot product previously studied allow us to investigate the properties of the directional derivative. Given that the directional derivative gives the instantaneous rate of change of when moving in the direction of , three questions naturally arise:     In what direction(s) is the change in the greatest ( , the steepest uphill )?    In what direction(s) is the change in the least ( , the steepest downhill )?    In what direction(s) is there no change in ?     Using the key property of the dot product, we have , where is the angle between the gradient and . (Since is a unit vector, .) This equation allows us to answer the three questions stated previously.      Equation is maximized when , , when the gradient and have the same direction. We conclude the gradient points in the direction of greatest change.     Equation is minimized when , , when the gradient and have opposite directions. We conclude the gradient points in the opposite direction of the least change.     Equation is 0 when , , when the gradient and are orthogonal to each other. We conclude the gradient is orthogonal to directions of no change.     This result is rather amazing. Once again imagine standing in a rolling meadow and face the direction that leads you steepest uphill. Then the direction that leads steepest downhill is directly behind you, and side-stepping either left or right ( , moving perpendicularly to the direction you face) does not change your elevation at all.  Recall that a level curve is defined as a curve in the -plane along which the -values of a function do not change. Let a surface be given, and let's represent one such level curve as a vector-valued function, . As the output of does not change along this curve, for all , for some constant .  Since is constant for all , . By the Multivariable Chain Rule, we also know .  This last equality states : the gradient is orthogonal to the derivative of , meaning the gradient is orthogonal to the graph of . Our conclusion: at any point on a surface, the gradient at that point is orthogonal to the level curve that passes through that point.  We restate these ideas in a theorem, then use them in an example.   The Gradient and Directional Derivatives   Let be differentiable on a set with gradient , let be a point in and let be a unit vector.     The maximum value of is ; the direction of maximal increase is .    The minimum value of is ; the direction of minimal increase is .    At , is orthogonal to the level curve passing through . gradient  directional derivative  derivative directional  level curves  gradient and level curves         Finding directions of maximal and minimal increase   Let and let . Find the directions of maximal\/minimal increase, and find a direction where the instantaneous rate of change is 0.    We begin by finding the gradient. and , thus .  Thus the direction of maximal increase is . In this direction, the instantaneous rate of change is .   Figure shows the surface plotted from two different perspectives. In each, the gradient is drawn at with a dashed line (because of the nature of this surface, the gradient points into the surface). Let be the unit vector in the direction of at . Each graph of the figure also contains the vector . This vector has a run of 1 (because in the -plane it moves 1 unit) and a rise of , hence we can think of it as a vector with slope of in the direction of , helping us visualize how steep the surface is in its steepest direction.   Graphing the surface and important directions in Example                       The direction of minimal increase is ; in this direction the instantaneous rate of change is .  Any direction orthogonal to is a direction of no change. We have two choices: the direction of and the direction of . The unit vector in the direction of is shown in each graph of the figure as well. The level curve at is drawn: recall that along this curve the -values do not change. Since is a direction of no -change, this vector is tangent to the level curve at .     Understanding when   Let . Find the directional derivative of in any direction at .    We find . At , we have . According to Theorem , this is the direction of maximal increase. However, is directionless; it has no displacement. And regardless of the unit vector chosen, .   Figure helps us understand what this means. We can see that lies at the top of a paraboloid. In all directions, the instantaneous rate of change is 0.  So what is the direction of maximal increase? It is fine to give an answer of , as this indicates that all directional derivatives are 0.   At the top of a paraboloid, all directional derivatives are 0           The fact that the gradient of a surface always points in the direction of steepest increase\/decrease is very useful, as illustrated in the following example.   The flow of water downhill   Consider the surface given by . Water is poured on the surface at . What path does it take as it flows downhill?    Let be the vector-valued function describing the path of the water in the -plane; we seek and . We know that water will always flow downhill in the steepest direction; therefore, at any point on its path, it will be moving in the direction of . (We ignore the physical effects of momentum on the water.) Thus will be parallel to , and there is some constant such that .  We find and write as and as . Then .  This implies  .  As equals both expressions, we have .  To find an explicit relationship between and , we can integrate both sides with respect to . Recall from our study of differentials that . Thus: .  As the water started at the point , we can solve for : .   A graph of the surface described in Example along with the path in the -plane with the level curves                       Thus the water follows the curve in the -plane. The surface and the path of the water is graphed in Figure . In Figure , the level curves of the surface are plotted in the -plane, along with the curve . Notice how the path intersects the level curves at right angles. As the path follows the gradient downhill, this reinforces the fact that the gradient is orthogonal to level curves.     Discussing the significance of directional derivatives      Functions of Three Variables  The concepts of directional derivatives and the gradient are easily extended to three (and more) variables. We combine the concepts behind Definitions and and Theorem into one set of definitions.   Directional Derivatives and Gradient with Three Variables   Let be differentiable on a set and let be a unit vector in . gradient  directional derivative  derivative directional    The gradient of is .    The directional derivative of in the direction of is .       The same properties of the gradient given in Theorem , when is a function of two variables, hold for , a function of three variables.   The Gradient and Directional Derivatives with Three Variables   Let be differentiable on a set , let be the gradient of , and let be a unit vector. gradient  directional derivative  derivative directional    The maximum value of is , obtained when the angle between and is 0, , the direction of maximal increase is .    The minimum value of is , obtained when the angle between and is , , the direction of minimal increase is .     when and are orthogonal.       We interpret the third statement of the theorem as the gradient is orthogonal to level surfaces, the three-variable analogue to level curves.   Finding directional derivatives with functions of three variables   If a point source is radiating energy, the intensity at a given point in space is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between and . That is, when , for some constant .  Let , let be a unit vector, and let . Measure distances in inches. Find the directional derivative of at in the direction of , and find the direction of greatest intensity increase at .    We need the gradient , meaning we need , and . Each partial derivative requires a simple application of the Quotient Rule, giving .  The directional derivative tells us that moving in the direction of from results in a decrease in intensity of about units per inch. (The intensity is decreasing as moves one farther from the origin than .)  The gradient gives the direction of greatest intensity increase. Notice that .  That is, the gradient at is pointing in the direction of , that is, towards the origin. That should make intuitive sense: the greatest increase in intensity is found by moving towards to source of the energy.    The directional derivative allows us to find the instantaneous rate of change in any direction at a point. We can use these instantaneous rates of change to define lines and planes that are tangent to a surface at a point, which is the topic of the next section.     Terms and Concepts   What is the difference between a directional derivative and a partial derivative?   A partial derivative is essentially a special case of a directional derivative; it is the directional derivative in the direction of or , , or .     For for what is              For for what is              The gradient is to level curves.             The gradient points in the direction of increase.   maximal, or greatest     It is generally more informative to view the directional derivative not as the result of a limit, but rather as the result of a product.

  "body": " Tangent Lines, Normal Lines, and Tangent Planes   Tangent Lines  Derivatives and tangent lines go hand-in-hand. Given , the line tangent to the graph of at is the line through with slope ; that is, the slope of the tangent line is the instantaneous rate of change of at .  When dealing with functions of two variables, the graph is no longer a curve but a surface. At a given point on the surface, it seems there are many lines that fit our intuition of being tangent to the surface.  In Section we introduced the concept of the tangent plane, which could be thought of as consisting of all possible lines tangent to the surface at a given point. In this section, we explore this idea in more detail.   Showing various lines tangent to a surface         In Figure we see lines that are tangent to curves in space. Since each curve lies on a surface, it makes sense to say that the lines are also tangent to the surface. The next definition formally defines what it means to be tangent to a surface.    Directional Tangent Line   Let be differentiable on a set containing and let be a unit vector. tangent line directional      The line through parallel to is the tangent line to in the direction of at .    The line through parallel to is the tangent line to in the direction of at .    The line through parallel to is the tangent line to in the direction of at .       It is instructive to consider each of three directions given in the definition in terms of slope. The direction of is ; that is, the run is one unit in the -direction and the rise is units in the -direction. Note how the slope is just the partial derivative with respect to . A similar statement can be made for . The direction of is ; the run is one unit in the direction (where is a unit vector) and the rise is the directional derivative of in that direction.   Definition leads to the following parametric equations of directional tangent lines:   .   Finding directional tangent lines   Find the lines tangent to the surface at in the and directions and also in the direction of .    The partial derivatives with respect to and are: .  At , the -value is 0.  Thus the parametric equations of the line tangent to at in the directions of and are: .  The two lines are shown with the surface in Figure .   A surface and directional tangent lines in Example                       To find the equation of the tangent line in the direction of , we first find the unit vector in the direction of : . The directional derivative at in the direction of is .  Thus the directional tangent line is .  The curve through in the direction of is shown in Figure along with .     Finding directional tangent lines   Let . Find the equations of all directional tangent lines to at .    First note that . We need to compute directional derivatives, so we need . We begin by computing partial derivatives. .  Thus . Let be any unit vector. The directional derivative of at will be . It does not matter what direction we choose; the directional derivative is always 0. Therefore .   Figure shows a graph of and the point . Note that this point comes at the top of a hill, and therefore every tangent line through this point will have a slope of 0.   Graphing in Example         That is, consider any curve on the surface that goes through this point. Each curve will have a relative maximum at this point, hence its tangent line will have a slope of 0. The following section investigates the points on surfaces where all tangent lines have a slope of 0.      Normal Lines  When dealing with a function of one variable, we stated that a line through was tangent to if the line had a slope of and was normal (or, perpendicular, orthogonal ) to if it had a slope of . We extend the concept of normal, or orthogonal, to functions of two variables.  Let be a differentiable function of two variables. By Definition , at , is a line parallel to the vector and is a line parallel to . Since lines in these directions through are tangent to the surface, a line through this point and orthogonal to these directions would be orthogonal , or normal , to the surface. We can use this direction to create a normal line.  The direction of the normal line is orthogonal to and , hence the direction is parallel to . It turns out this cross product has a very simple form: .  It is often more convenient to refer to the opposite of this direction, namely . This leads to a definition.   Normal Line   Let be differentiable on a set containing where are defined. normal line  orthogonal      A nonzero vector parallel to is orthogonal to at .    The line through with direction parallel to is the normal line to at .       Thus the parametric equations of the normal line to a surface at is: .   Finding a normal line   Find the equation of the normal line to at .    We find and ; at , we have and . We take the direction of the normal line, following Definition , to be . The line with this direction going through the point is .   Graphing a surface with a normal line from Example         The surface , along with the found normal line, is graphed in Figure .    The direction of the normal line has many uses, one of which is the definition of the tangent plane which we define shortly. Another use is in measuring distances from the surface to a point. Given a point in space, it is a general geometric concept to define the distance from to the surface as being the length of the shortest line segment over all points on the surface. This, in turn, implies that will be orthogonal to the surface at . Therefore we can measure the distance from to the surface by finding a point on the surface such that is parallel to the normal line to at .   Finding the distance from a point to a surface   Let and let . Find the distance from to the surface defined by .    This surface is used in Example , so we know that at , the direction of the normal line will be . A point on the surface will have coordinates , so . To find where is parallel to , we need to find , and such that .   In each equation, we can solve for : .  The first two fractions imply , and so the last fraction can be rewritten as . Then .  This last equation is a cubic, which is not difficult to solve with a numeric solver. We find that , hence . We find the distance from to the surface of is .    We can take the concept of measuring the distance from a point to a surface to find a point a particular distance from a surface at a given point on the surface.   Finding a point a set distance from a surface   Let . Let . Find points in space that are 4 units from the surface of at . That is, find such that and is orthogonal to at .    We begin by finding partial derivatives:   The vector is orthogonal to at . For reasons that will become more clear in a moment, we find the unit vector in the direction of : .  Thus a the normal line to at can be written as .  An advantage of this parametrization of the line is that letting gives a point on the line that is units from . (This is because the direction of the line is given in terms of a unit vector.) There are thus two points in space 4 units from :    Graphing the surface in Example along with points 4 units from the surface         The surface is graphed along with points , , and a portion of the normal line to at .      Tangent Planes  We can use the direction of the normal line to define a plane. With , and , the vector is orthogonal to at . (See Definition .) The plane through with normal vector is therefore tangent to at .   When we introduced the tangent plane in Section , we computed the normal vector to be . Here, for convenience, we take the negative of this vector, and use .    Tangent Plane   Let be differentiable on a set containing , where , , and .  The plane through with normal vector is the tangent plane to at . The standard form of this plane is tangent plane  planes tangent  .     Finding tangent planes   Find the equation of the tangent plane to at .    Note that this is the same surface and point used in Example . There we found and . Therefore the equation of the tangent plane is .   Graphing a surface with tangent plane from Example         The surface and tangent plane are graphed in Figure .     Using the tangent plane to approximate function values   The point lies on the surface of an unknown differentiable function where and . Find the equation of the tangent plane to at , and use this to approximate the value of .    Knowing the partial derivatives at allows us to form the normal vector to the tangent plane, . Thus the equation of the tangent line to at is: .  Just as tangent lines provide excellent approximations of curves near their point of intersection, tangent planes provide excellent approximations of surfaces near their point of intersection. So .  This is not a new method of approximation. Compare the right hand expression for in Equation to the total differential: .  Thus the new -value is the sum of the change in ( , ) and the old -value (4). As mentioned when studying the total differential, it is not uncommon to know partial derivative information about a unknown function, and tangent planes are used to give accurate approximations of the function.      The Gradient and Normal Lines, Tangent Planes  The methods developed in this section so far give a straightforward method of finding equations of normal lines and tangent planes for surfaces with explicit equations of the form . However, they do not handle implicit equations well, such as . There is a technique that allows us to find vectors orthogonal to these surfaces based on the gradient .   Gradient   Let be differentiable on a set that contains the point . gradient      The gradient of is .    The gradient of at is .       Recall that when , the gradient is orthogonal to level curves of . An analogous statement can be made about the gradient , where . Given a point , let . Then is a level surface that contains the point . The following theorem states that is orthogonal to this level surface.   The Gradient and Level Surfaces   Let be differentiable on a set containing with gradient , where .  The vector is orthogonal to the level surface at . gradient and level surfaces  level surface     The gradient at a point gives a vector orthogonal to the surface at that point. This direction can be used to find tangent planes and normal lines.   Using the gradient to find a tangent plane   Find the equation of the plane tangent to the ellipsoid at .    We consider the equation of the ellipsoid as a level surface of a function of three variables, where . The gradient is: .  At , the gradient is . Thus the equation of the plane tangent to the ellipsoid at is .   An ellipsoid and its tangent plane at a point         The ellipsoid and tangent plane are graphed in Figure .    To understand why is true, recall the method of implicit differentiation given in . A level surface can be viewed as defining implicitly. We found that the partial derivatives of with respect to and are then given by . If we plug these values into the tangent plane equation we get, with , . If we move everything to the left-hand side of the equation and multiply through by , we get , which is the equation of a plane with normal vector .   Finding the tangent plane of a level surface   Determine the equation of the tangent plane to the level surface at the point . (Note that this is the same problem as .)    With we have .  The equation of the tangent plane is therefore . Note that solving for gives , which is the same result as .    Tangent lines and planes to surfaces have many uses, including the study of instantaneous rates of changes and making approximations. Normal lines also have many uses. In this section we focused on using them to measure distances from a surface. Another interesting application is in computer graphics, where the effects of light on a surface are determined using normal vectors.  The next section investigates another use of partial derivatives: determining relative extrema. When dealing with functions of the form , we found relative extrema by finding where . We can start finding relative extrema of by setting and to 0, but it turns out that there is more to consider.     Terms and Concepts   Explain how the vector can be thought of as having a slope of 3.   Answers will vary. The displacement of the vector is one unit in the -direction and 3 units in the -direction, with no change in . Thus along a line parallel to , the change in is 3 times the change in   , a slope of 3. Specifically, the line in the -plane parallel to has a slope of 3.    Explain how the vector can be thought of as having a slope of .   Answers will vary. Let ; this is a unit vector. The displacement of the vector is one unit in the -direction and units in the -direction. In the plane containing the -axis and the vector , the line parallel to has slope .     True or False? Let be differentiable at If is a normal vector to the tangent plane of at then is orthogonal to and at    ?    True    False               Explain in your own words why we do not refer to the tangent line to a surface at a point, but rather to directional tangent line s to a surface at a point.   On a surface through a point, there are many different smooth curves, each with a tangent line at the point. Each of these tangent lines is also tangent to the surface. There is not just one tangent line, but many, each in a different direction. Therefore we refer to directional tangent lines, not just the tangent line.     Problems    A function , a vector and a point are given.

  "title": "Extreme Values",
  "body": " Extreme Values   Critical Points of Functions of Two Variables   Introducing extreme values for functions of several variables    Given a function , we are often interested in points where takes on the largest or smallest values. For instance, if represents a cost function, we would likely want to know what values minimize the cost. If represents the ratio of a volume to surface area, we would likely want to know where is greatest. This leads to the following definition.   Relative and Absolute Extrema   Let be defined on a set containing the point . maximum relative\/local  minimum relative\/local  extrema relative  extrema absolute  maximum absolute  minimum absolute    If for all in , then has an absolute maximum at If for all in , then has an absolute minimum at .    If there is an open disk containing such that for all points that are in both and , then has a relative maximum at . If there is an open disk containing such that for all points that are in both and , then has a relative minimum at .    If has an absolute maximum or minimum at , then has an absolute extremum at . If has a relative maximum or minimum at , then has a relative extremum at .       If has a relative or absolute maximum at , it means every curve on the surface of through will also have a relative or absolute maximum at . Recalling what we learned in Section , the slopes of the tangent lines to these curves at must be 0 or undefined. Since directional derivatives are computed using and , we are led to the following definition and theorem.   Critical Point   Let be continuous on a set . A critical point  of is a point in such that, at , critical point     and , or     and\/or is undefined.        Critical Points and Relative Extrema   Let be defined on an open set containing . If has a relative extrema at , then is a critical point of . extrema relative  critical point     Therefore, to find relative extrema, we find the critical points of and determine which correspond to relative maxima, relative minima, or neither. The following examples demonstrate this process.   Finding critical points     Finding critical points and relative extrema   Let . Find the relative extrema of .    We start by computing the partial derivatives of : .  Each is never undefined. A critical point occurs when and are simultaneously 0, leading us to solve the following system of linear equations: .  This solution to this system is , . (Check that at , both and are 0.)   The surface in Example with its absolute minimum indicated         The graph in Figure shows along with this critical point. It is clear from the graph that this is a relative minimum; further consideration of the function shows that this is actually the absolute minimum.     Finding critical points and relative extrema   Let . Find the relative extrema of .    We start by computing the partial derivatives of : .  It is clear that when & , and that when & . At , both and are not  , but rather undefined. The point is still a critical point, though, because the partial derivatives are undefined. This is the only critical point of .   The surface in Example with its absolute maximum indicated         The surface of is graphed in Figure along with the point . The graph shows that this point is the absolute maximum of .    In each of the previous two examples, we found a critical point of and then determined whether or not it was a relative (or absolute) maximum or minimum by graphing. It would be nice to be able to determine whether a critical point corresponded to a max or a min without a graph. Before we develop such a test, we do one more example that sheds more light on the issues our test needs to consider.   Finding critical points and relative extrema   Let . Find the relative extrema of .    Once again we start by finding the partial derivatives of : .  Each is always defined. Setting each equal to 0 and solving for and , we find .  We have two critical points: and . To determine if they correspond to a relative maximum or minimum, we consider the graph of in Figure .   The surface in Example with both critical points marked         The critical point clearly corresponds to a relative maximum. However, the critical point at is neither a maximum nor a minimum, displaying a different, interesting characteristic.  If one walks parallel to the -axis towards this critical point, then this point becomes a relative maximum along this path. But if one walks towards this point parallel to the -axis, this point becomes a relative minimum along this path. A point that seems to act as both a max and a min is a saddle point . A formal definition follows.     Saddle Point   Let be in the domain of where and at . We say is a saddle point of if, for every open disk containing , there are points and in such that and . saddle point  critical point     At a saddle point, the instantaneous rate of change in all directions is 0 and there are points nearby with -values both less than and greater than the -value of the saddle point.  Before Example we mentioned the need for a test to differentiate between relative maxima and minima. We now recognize that our test also needs to account for saddle points. To do so, we consider the second partial derivatives of .  Recall that with single variable functions, such as , if , then is concave up at , and if , then has a relative minimum at . (We called this the Second Derivative Test.) Note that at a saddle point, it seems the graph is both concave up and concave down, depending on which direction you are considering.  It would be nice if the following were true:    and   relative minimum    and   relative maximum    and have opposite signs   saddle point.    However, this is not the case. Functions exist where and are both positive but a saddle point still exists. In such a case, while the concavity in the -direction is up ( , ) and the concavity in the -direction is also up ( , ), the concavity switches somewhere in between the - and -directions.  To account for this, consider . Since and are equal when continuous (refer back to Theorem ), we can rewrite this as . can be used to test whether the concavity at a point changes depending on direction. If , the concavity does not switch ( , at that point, the graph is concave up or down in all directions). If , the concavity does switch. If , our test fails to determine whether concavity switches or not. We state the use of in the following theorem.   Second Derivative Test   Let be an open set on which a function and all its first and second partial derivatives are defined, let be a critical point of in , and let Second Derivative Test  maximum relative\/local  minimum relative\/local  saddle point  .     If and , then has a relative minimum at .    If and , then has a relative maximum at .    If , then has a saddle point at .    If , the test is inconclusive.        Presenting the second derivative test    We first practice using this test with the function in the previous example, where we visually determined we had a relative maximum and a saddle point.   Using the Second Derivative Test   Let as in Example . Determine whether the function has a relative minimum, maximum, or saddle point at each critical point.    We determined previously that the critical points of are and . To use the Second Derivative Test, we must find the second partial derivatives of : .  Thus .  At : , and . By the Second Derivative Test, has a relative maximum at .  At : . The Second Derivative Test states that has a saddle point at .  The Second Derivative Test confirmed what we determined visually.     Using the Second Derivative Test   Find the relative extrema of .    We start by finding the first and second partial derivatives of : .  We find the critical points by finding where and are simultaneously 0 (they are both never undefined). Setting , we have: .  This implies that for , either or .  Assume then consider : .  Thus if , we have either or , giving two critical points: and .  Going back to , now assume , , that , then consider : .  Thus if , giving the critical point .  With , we apply the Second Derivative Test to each critical point.  At , , so is a saddle point.  At , , so is also a saddle point.  At , and , so is a relative minimum.   Graphing from Example and its relative extrema          Figure shows a graph of and the three critical points. Note how this function does not vary much near the critical points that is, visually it is difficult to determine whether a point is a saddle point or relative minimum (or even a critical point at all!). This is one reason why the Second Derivative Test is so important to have.     Two more examples with classification of critical points      Constrained Optimization  When optimizing functions of one variable such as , we made use of Theorem , the Extreme Value Theorem, that said that over a closed interval , a continuous function has both a maximum and minimum value. To find these maximum and minimum values, we evaluated at all critical points in the interval, as well as at the endpoints (the boundary ) of the interval. constrained optimization  optimization constrained   A similar theorem and procedure applies to functions of two variables. A continuous function over a closed set also attains a maximum and minimum value (see the following theorem). We can find these values by evaluating the function at the critical values in the set and over the boundary of the set. After formally stating this extreme value theorem, we give examples.   Extreme Value Theorem   Let be a continuous function on a closed, bounded set . Then has a maximum and minimum value on . Extreme Value Theorem      Finding extrema on a closed set   Let and let be the triangle with vertices , and . Find the maximum and minimum values of on .    It can help to see a graph of along with the set . In Figure the triangle defining is shown in the -plane in a dashed line. Above it is the surface of ; we are only concerned with the portion of enclosed by the triangle on its surface.   Plotting the surface of along with the restricted domain in Example                       We begin by finding the critical points of . With and , we find only one critical point, at .  We now find the maximum and minimum values that attains along the boundary of , that is, along the edges of the triangle. In Figure we see the triangle sketched in the plane with the equations of the lines forming its edges labeled.  Start with the bottom edge, along the line . If is , then on the surface, we are considering points ; that is, our function reduces to . We want to maximize\/minimize on the interval . To do so, we evaluate at its critical points and at the endpoints.  The critical points of are found by setting its derivative equal to 0: .  Evaluating at this critical point, and at the endpoints of gives: .  Notice how evaluating at a point is the same as evaluating at its corresponding point.  We need to do this process twice more, for the other two edges of the triangle.  Along the left edge, along the line , we substitute in for in : .  We want the maximum and minimum values of on the interval , so we evaluate at its critical points and the endpoints of the interval. We find the critical points: .  Evaluate at its critical point and the endpoints of : .  Finally, we evaluate along the right edge of the triangle, where . .  The critical points of are: .  We evaluate at this critical point and at the endpoints of the interval : .  One last point to test: the critical point of , . We find .   The surface of along with important points along the boundary of and the interior in Example         We have evaluated at a total of 7 different places, all shown in Figure . We checked each vertex of the triangle twice, as each showed up as the endpoint of an interval twice. Of all the -values found, the maximum is 5.8, found at ; the minimum is 1, found at .    This portion of the text is entitled Constrained Optimization because we want to optimize a function ( , find its maximum and\/or minimum values) subject to a constraint  some limit to what values the function can attain. In the previous example, we constrained ourselves by considering a function only within the boundary of a triangle. This was largely arbitrary; the function and the boundary were chosen just as an example, with no real meaning behind the function or the chosen constraint.  However, solving constrained optimization problems is a very important topic in applied mathematics. The techniques developed here are the basis for solving larger problems, where more than two variables are involved.   Finding extreme values (two videos)    We illustrate the technique once more with a classic problem.   Constrained Optimization   The U.S. Postal Service states that the girth+length of Standard Post Package must not exceed 130''. Given a rectangular box, the length is the longest side, and the girth is twice the width+height.  Given a rectangular box where the width and height are equal, what are the dimensions of the box that give the maximum volume subject to the constraint of the size of a Standard Post Package?    Let , and denote the width, height and length of a rectangular box; we assume here that . The girth is then . The volume of the box is . We wish to maximize this volume subject to the constraint , or . (Common sense also indicates that .)  We begin by finding the critical values of . We find that and ; these are simultaneously 0 only at . This gives a volume of 0, so we can ignore this critical point.  We now consider the volume along the constraint . Along this line, we have: .  The constraint is applicable on the -interval as indicated in the figure. Thus we want to maximize on .  Finding the critical values of , we take the derivative and set it equal to 0: .  We found two critical values: when and when . We again ignore the solution; the maximum volume, subject to the constraint, comes at , . This gives a volume of in .   Graphing the volume of a box with girth and length , subject to a size constraint         The volume function is shown in Figure along with the constraint . As done previously, the constraint is drawn dashed in the -plane and also along the surface of the function. The point where the volume is maximized is indicated.    It is hard to overemphasize the importance of optimization. In the real world, we routinely seek to make something better. By expressing the something as a mathematical function, making something better means optimize some function.   The techniques shown here are only the beginning of an incredibly important field. Many functions that we seek to optimize are incredibly complex, making the step of find the gradient and set it equal to highly nontrivial. Mastery of the principles here are key to being able to tackle these more complicated problems.     Terms and Concepts    True or False? Theorem 13.8.4 states that if has a critical point at then has a relative extrema at    ?    True    False                True or False? A point is a critical point of if and are both at    ?    True    False                True or False? A point is a critical point of if or are undefined at    ?    True    False               Explain what it means to solve a constrained optimization problem.   Answers will vary. A good answer will state that we are optimizing a function subject to a constraint, or limit, on the domain of the function. We are looking to maximize\/minimize the function while looking at only a certain part of the domain.     Problems    Find the critical points of the given function. Use the Second Derivative Test to determine if each critical point corresponds to a relative maximum, minimum, or saddle point.        One critical point at ; and , so this point corresponds to a relative minimum.                                    One critical point at ; , so this point corresponds to a saddle point.                                    Two critical points: at ; and , so this point corresponds to a saddle point;  at , and , so this corresponds to a relative minimum.                                    There are infinitly many critical points, whenever or . With , at each critical point and the test is inconclusive. (Some elementary thought shows that each is the absolute minimum, since for all .)

  "body": " Iterated Integrals and Area   In Section we found that it was useful to differentiate functions of several variables with respect to one variable, while treating all the other variables as constants or coefficients. We can integrate functions of several variables in a similar way. For instance, if we are told that , we can treat as staying constant and integrate to obtain : .  Make a careful note about the constant of integration, . This constant is something with a derivative of with respect to , so it could be any expression that contains only constants and functions of . For instance, if , then . To signify that is actually a function of , we write: integration of multivariable functions  .  Using this process we can even evaluate definite integrals.    Iterated integrals   Integrating functions of more than one variable   Evaluate the integral .    We find the indefinite integral as before, then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the definite integral: .    We can also integrate with respect to . In general, , and .  Note that when integrating with respect to , the bounds are functions of (of the form and ) and the final result is also a function of . When integrating with respect to , the bounds are functions of (of the form and ) and the final result is a function of . Another example will help us understand this.   Integrating functions of more than one variable   Evaluate .    We consider as staying constant and integrate with respect to : .  Note how the bounds of the integral are from to and that the final answer is a function of .    In the previous example, we integrated a function with respect to and ended up with a function of . We can integrate this as well. This process is known as iterated integration , or multiple integration.    Evaluating an integral   Evaluate .    We follow a standard order of operations and perform the operations inside parentheses first (which is the integral evaluated in Example .) .  Note how the bounds of were to and the final result was a number.    The previous example showed how we could perform something called an iterated integral; we do not yet know why we would be interested in doing so nor what the result, such as the number , means . Before we investigate these questions, we offer some definitions.   Iterated Integration    Iterated integration is the process of repeatedly integrating the results of previous integrations. Evaulating one integral is denoted as follows.  Let , , and be numbers and let , , and be functions of and , respectively. Then: integration iterated  integration multiple  iterated integration  multiple integration|see{iterated integration}  integration notation       .     .       Again make note of the bounds of these iterated integrals.  With , varies from to , whereas varies from to . That is, the bounds of are curves , the curves and , whereas the bounds of are constants , and . It is useful to remember that when setting up and evaluating such iterated integrals, we integrate from curve to curve, then from point to point.   We now begin to investigate why we are interested in iterated integrals and what they mean.    Area of a plane region  Consider the plane region bounded by and , shown in Figure . We learned in Section that the area of is given by integration area  .   Calculating the area of a plane region with an iterated integral         We can view the expression as , meaning we can express the area of as an iterated integral: .  In short: a certain iterated integral can be viewed as giving the area of a plane region.  A region could also be defined by and , as shown in Figure . Using a process similar to that above, we have .   Calculating the area of a plane region with an iterated integral         We state this formally in a theorem.   Area of a plane region      Let be a plane region bounded by and , where and are continuous functions on . The area of is .    Let be a plane region bounded by and , where and are continuous functions on . The area of is integration area  .       The following examples should help us understand this theorem.   Area of a rectangle   Find the area of the rectangle with corners and , as shown in Figure .   Calculating the area of a rectangle with an iterated integral in Example           Multiple integration is obviously overkill in this situation, but we proceed to establish its use.  The region is bounded by , , and . Choosing to integrate with respect to first, we have .  We could also integrate with respect to first, giving: .  Clearly there are simpler ways to find this area, but it is interesting to note that this method works.     Area of a triangle   Find the area of the triangle with vertices at , and , as shown in Figure .   Calculating the area of a triangle with iterated integrals in Example           The triangle is bounded by the lines as shown in the figure. Choosing to integrate with respect to first gives that is bounded by to , while is bounded by to . (Recall that since -values increase from left to right, the leftmost curve, , is the lower bound and the rightmost curve, , is the upper bound.) The area is .  We can also find the area by integrating with respect to first. In this situation, though, we have two functions that act as the lower bound for the region , and . This requires us to use two iterated integrals. Note how the -bounds are different for each integral: .  As expected, we get the same answer both ways.     Area of a plane region   Find the area of the region enclosed by and , as shown in Figure .   Calculating the area of a plane region with iterated integrals in Example           Once again we'll find the area of the region using both orders of integration.  Using : .  Using : .      Changing Order of Integration  In each of the previous examples, we have been given a region and found the bounds needed to find the area of using both orders of integration. We integrated using both orders of integration to demonstrate their equality. iterated integration changing order   We now approach the skill of describing a region using both orders of integration from a different perspective. Instead of starting with a region and creating iterated integrals, we will start with an iterated integral and rewrite it in the other integration order. To do so, we'll need to understand the region over which we are integrating.  The simplest of all cases is when both integrals are bound by constants. The region described by these bounds is a rectangle (see Example ), and so: .  When the inner integral's bounds are not constants, it is generally very useful to sketch the bounds to determine what the region we are integrating over looks like. From the sketch we can then rewrite the integral with the other order of integration.  Examples will help us develop this skill.   Changing the order of integration   Rewrite the iterated integral with the order of integration .    We need to use the bounds of integration to determine the region we are integrating over.  The bounds tell us that is bounded by and ; is bounded by 0 and 6. We plot these four curves: , , and to find the region described by the bounds. Figure shows these curves, indicating that is a triangle.   Sketching the region described by the iterated integral in Example         To change the order of integration, we need to consider the curves that bound the -values. We see that the lower bound is and the upper bound is . The bounds on are to . Thus we can rewrite the integral as .     Changing the order of integration   Change the order of integration of .    We sketch the region described by the bounds to help us change the integration order. is bounded below and above ( , to the left and right) by and respectively, and is bounded between 0 and 4. Graphing the previous curves, we find the region to be that shown in Figure .   Drawing the region determined by the bounds of integration in Example         To change the order of integration, we need to establish curves that bound . The figure makes it clear that there are two lower bounds for : on , and on . Thus we need two double integrals. The upper bound for each is . Thus we have .    This section has introduced a new concept, the iterated integral. We developed one application for iterated integration: area between curves. However, this is not new, for we already know how to find areas bounded by curves.  In the next section we apply iterated integration to solve problems we currently do not know how to handle. The real goal of this section was not to learn a new way of computing area. Rather, our goal was to learn how to define a region in the plane using the bounds of an iterated integral. That skill is very important in the following sections.     Terms and Concepts   When integrating with respect to , the constant of integration is really which: or ? What does this mean?    , meaning that instead of being just a constant, like the number 5, it is a function of , which acts like a constant when taking derivatives with respect to .    Evaluating a double integral in steps is called  .   iterated integration    When evaluating an iterated integral, we integrate from to , then from to .   curve to curve, then from point to point    One understanding of an iterated integral is that gives the of a plane region.   area     Problems    In the following exercises, evaluate the integral and subsequent iterated integral.

  "title": "Double Integration and Volume",
  "body": " Double Integration and Volume  The definite integral of over , , was introduced as the signed area under the curve. We approximated the value of this area by first subdividing into subintervals, where the th subinterval has length , and letting be any value in the th subinterval. We formed rectangles that approximated part of the region under the curve with width , height , and hence with area . Summing all the rectangle's areas gave an approximation of the definite integral, and Theorem stated that , connecting the area under the curve with sums of the areas of rectangles.  We use a similar approach in this section to find volume under a surface.   Introducing the double integral    Let be a closed, bounded region in the -plane and let be a continuous function defined on . We wish to find the signed volume under the surface of over . (We use the term signed volume to denote that space above the -plane, under , will have a positive volume; space above and under the -plane will have a negative volume, similar to the notion of signed area used before.)  We start by partitioning into rectangular subregions as shown in Figure . For simplicity's sake, we let all widths be and all heights be . Note that the sum of the areas of the rectangles is not equal to the area of , but rather is a close approximation. Arbitrarily number the rectangles 1 through , and pick a point in the th subregion.   Developing a method for finding signed volume under a surface                       The volume of the rectangular solid whose base is the th subregion and whose height is is . Such a solid is shown in Figure . Note how this rectangular solid only approximates the true volume under the surface; part of the solid is above the surface and part is below.  For each subregion used to approximate , create the rectangular solid with base area and height . The sum of all rectangular solids is .  This approximates the signed volume under over . As we have done before, to get a better approximation we can use more rectangles to approximate the region .  In general, each rectangle could have a different width and height , giving the th rectangle an area and the th rectangular solid a volume of . Let denote the length of the longest diagonal of all rectangles in the subdivision of ; means each rectangle's width and height are both approaching 0. If is a continuous function, as shrinks (and hence ) the summation approximates the signed volume better and better. This leads to a definition.   Double integrals as limits of double sums  Recall that the integration symbol is an elongated S, representing the word sum. We interpreted as take the sum of the areas of rectangles over the interval . The double integral uses two integration symbols to represent a double sum. When adding up the volumes of rectangular solids over a partition of a region , as done in Figure , one could first add up the volumes across each row (one type of sum), then add these totals together (another sum), as in .  One can rewrite this as .  The summation inside the parenthesis indicates the sum of heights widths, which gives an area; multiplying these areas by the thickness gives a volume. The illustration in Figure relates to this understanding.    Double Integral, Signed Volume   Let be a continuous function defined over a closed, bounded region in the -plane. The signed volume  under over is denoted by the double integral  .  Alternate notations for the double integral are integration double  double integral  iterated integration  signed volume  volume  .     Defining the double integral     does not state how to find the signed volume, though the notation offers a hint. We need the next two theorems to evaluate double integrals to find volume.   Double Integrals and Signed Volume   Let be a continuous function defined over a closed , bounded region in the -plane. Then the signed volume under over is .    This theorem states that we can find the exact signed volume using a limit of sums. The partition of the region is not specified, so any partitioning where the diagonal of each rectangle shrinks to 0 results in the same answer.  This does not offer a very satisfying way of computing volume, though. Our experience has shown that evaluating the limits of sums can be tedious. We seek a more direct method.  Recall Theorem in Section . This stated that if gives the cross-sectional area of a solid at , then gave the volume of that solid over .  Consider Figure , where a surface is drawn over a region . Fixing a particular value, we can consider the area under over where has that fixed value. That area can be found with a definite integral, namely .  Remember that though the integrand contains , we are viewing as fixed. Also note that the bounds of integration are functions of : the bounds depend on the value of .   Finding volume under a surface by sweeping out a cross-sectional area         As is a cross-sectional area function, we can find the signed volume under by integrating it: .  This gives a concrete method for finding signed volume under a surface. We could do a similar procedure where we started with fixed, resulting in an iterated integral with the order of integration . The following theorem states that both methods give the same result, which is the value of the double integral. It is such an important theorem it has a name associated with it.   Fubini's Theorem   Let be a closed, bounded region in the -plane and let be a continuous function on . double integral  iterated integration  signed volume  volume  Fubini's Theorem      If is bounded by and , where and are continuous functions on , then .    If is bounded by and , where and are continuous functions on , then .       Note that once again the bounds of integration follow the curve to curve, point to point pattern discussed in the previous section. In fact, one of the main points of the previous section is developing the skill of describing a region with the bounds of an iterated integral. Once this skill is developed, we can use double integrals to compute many quantities, not just signed volume under a surface.   Fubini's Theorem and iterated integrals     Evaluating a double integral   Let . Find the signed volume under on the region , which is the rectangle with corners and pictured in Figure , using Fubini's Theorem and both orders of integration.   Finding the signed volume under a surface in Example           We wish to evaluate . As is a rectangle, the bounds are easily described as and .  Using the order : .  Now we check the validity of Fubini's Theorem by using the order : .  Both orders of integration return the same result, as expected.     Evaluating a double integral   Evaluate , where is the triangle bounded by , and , as shown in Figure .   Finding the signed volume under the surface in Example           While it is not specified which order we are to use, we will evaluate the double integral using both orders to help drive home the point that it does not matter which order we use.  Using the order : The bounds on go from curve to curve,  , , and the bounds on go from point to point,  , . .  Now lets consider the order . Here goes from curve to curve,  , and goes from point to point,  : .  We obtained the same result using both orders of integration.     Further examples of double integrals over rectangles    Note how in these examples that the bounds of integration depend only on ; the bounds of integration have nothing to do with . This is an important concept, so we include it as a Key Idea.   Double Integration Bounds  When evaluating using an iterated integral, the bounds of integration depend only on . The surface does not determine the bounds of integration.   Before doing another example, we give some properties of double integrals. Each should make sense if we view them in the context of finding signed volume under a surface, over a region.   Properties of Double Integrals   Let and be continuous functions over a closed, bounded plane region , and let be a constant. double integral properties  iterated integration properties       .         If on , then .    If on , then .    Let be the union of two nonoverlapping regions, (see Figure ). Then .   is the union of two nonoverlapping regions, and               Evaluating a double integral over a more general region     Evaluating a double integral   Let and be the triangle with vertices , and (see Figure ). Evaluate the double integral .   Finding the signed volume under a surface in Example           If we attempt to integrate using an iterated integral with the order , note how there are two upper bounds on meaning we'll need to use two iterated integrals. We would need to split the triangle into two regions along the -axis, then use Theorem , part .  Instead, let's use the order . The curves bounding are ; the bounds on are . This gives us: .  Recall that the cosine function is an even function; that is, . Therefore, from the last integral above, we have . Thus the integrand simplifies to 0, and we have .  It turns out that over , there is just as much volume above the -plane as below (look again at Figure ), giving a final signed volume of 0.     Finding the volume of a tetrahedron     Evaluating a double integral   Evaluate , where is the region bounded by the parabolas and , graphed in Figure .   Finding the volume under the surface in Example           Graphing each curve can help us find their points of intersection. Solving analytically, the second equation tells us that . Substituting this value in for in the first equation gives us . Solving for : .  Thus we've found analytically what was easy to approximate graphically: the regions intersect at and , as shown in Figure .  We now choose an order of integration: or ? Either order works; since the integrand does not contain , choosing might be simpler at least, the first integral is very simple.  Thus we have the following curve to curve, point to point bounds: . Therefore, .  The signed volume under the surface is about 11.7 cubic units.     Evaluating a double integral over a general region    In the previous section we practiced changing the order of integration of a given iterated integral, where the region was not explicitly given. Changing the bounds of an integral is more than just an test of understanding. Rather, there are cases where integrating in one order is really hard, if not impossible, whereas integrating with the other order is feasible.   Changing the order of integration   Rewrite the iterated integral with the order . Comment on the feasibility to evaluate each integral.    Once again we make a sketch of the region over which we are integrating to facilitate changing the order. The bounds on are from to ; the bounds on are from to . These curves are sketched in Figure , enclosing the region .   Determining the region determined by the bounds of integration in Example         To change the bounds, note that the curves bounding are up to ; the triangle is enclosed between and . Thus the new bounds of integration are and , giving the iterated integral .  How easy is it to evaluate each iterated integral? Consider the order of integrating , as given in the original problem. The first indefinite integral we need to evaluate is ; we have stated before (see Section ) that this integral cannot be evaluated in terms of elementary functions. We are stuck.  Changing the order of integration makes a big difference here. In the second iterated integral, we are faced with ; integrating with respect to gives us , and the first definite integral evaluates to .  Thus .  This last integral is easy to evaluate with substitution, giving a final answer of . Figure shows the surface over .   Showing the surface defined in Example over its region         In short, evaluating one iterated integral is impossible; the other iterated integral is relatively simple.     Two more examples of changing the order of integration     Definition defines the average value of a single-variable function on the interval as that is, it is the area under over an interval divided by the length of the interval. We make an analogous statement here: the average value of over a region is the volume under over divided by the area of .   The Average Value of on   Let be a continuous function defined over a closed, bounded region in the -plane. The average value of on is average value of a function  .     Finding average value of a function over a region   Find the average value of over the region , which is bounded by the parabolas and . Note: this is the same function and region as used in Example .    In Example we found .  We find the area of by computing : .  Dividing the volume under the surface by the area gives the average value: .  While the surface, as shown in Figure , covers -values from to , the average  -value on is 2.2.   Finding the average value of in Example           The previous section introduced the iterated integral in the context of finding the area of plane regions. This section has extended our understanding of iterated integrals; now we see they can be used to find the signed volume under a surface.  This new understanding allows us to revisit what we did in the previous section. Given a region in the plane, we computed ; again, our understanding at the time was that we were finding the area of . However, we can now view the graph as a surface, a flat surface with constant -value of 1. The double integral finds the volume, under , over , as shown in Figure . Basic geometry tells us that if the base of a general right cylinder has area , its volume is , where is the height. In our case, the height is 1. We were actually computing the volume of a solid, though we interpreted the number as an area.   Showing how an iterated integral used to find area also finds a certain volume         The next section extends our abilities to find volumes under surfaces. Currently, some integrals are hard to compute because either the region we are integrating over is hard to define with rectangular curves, or the integrand itself is hard to deal with. Some of these problems can be solved by converting everything into polar coordinates.    Terms and Concepts   An integral can be interpreted as giving the signed area over an interval; a double integral can be interpreted as giving the signed over a region.   volume    Explain why the following statement is false: Fubini's Theorem states that .   When switching the order of integration, the bounds integrals must change to reflect the bounds of the region of integration. You cannot merely change the letters and in a few places.    Explain why if over a region , then   .   The double integral gives the signed volume under the surface. Since the surface is always positive, it is always above the -plane and hence produces only positive volume.    If , does this imply ?   No. It means that there is the same amount of signed volume under and over , but the functions could be very different.

The integrand is simply , and the bounds of the integrals are determined by the region .  Some regions are easy to describe using rectangular coordinates that is, with equations of the form , , etc. However, some regions are easier to handle if we represent their boundaries with polar equations of the form , , etc.   Introducing the double integral in polar coordinates    The basic form of the double integral is . We interpret this integral as follows: over the region , sum up lots of products of heights (given by ) and areas (given by ). That is, represents a little bit of area. In rectangular coordinates, we can describe a small rectangle as having area or  the area of a rectangle is simply length width a small change in times a small change in . Thus we replace in the double integral with or .   Approximating a region with portions of sectors of circles                       Now consider representing a region with polar coordinates. Consider Figure . Let be the region in the first quadrant bounded by the curve. We can approximate this region using the natural shape of polar coordinates: portions of sectors of circles. In the figure, one such region is shaded, shown again in Figure .  As the area of a sector of a circle with radius , subtended by an angle , is , we can find the area of the shaded region. The whole sector has area , whereas the smaller, unshaded sector has area . The area of the shaded region is the difference of these areas: .  Note that is just the average of the two radii.  To approximate the region , we use many such subregions; doing so shrinks the difference between radii to 0 and shrinks the change in angle also to 0. We represent these infinitesimal changes in radius and angle as and , respectively. Finally, as is small, , and so . Thus, when and are small, .  Taking a limit, where the number of subregions goes to infinity and both and go to 0, we get .  So to evaluate , replace with . Convert the function to a function with polar coordinates with the substitutions , . Finally, find bounds and that describe . This is the key principle of this section, so we restate it here as a Key Idea.   Evaluating Double Integrals with Polar Coordinates  Let be a continuous function defined over a closed, bounded region in the -plane, where is bounded by the polar equations and . Then double integral in polar  .   Examples will help us understand this Key Idea.   Evaluating a double integral with polar coordinates   Find the signed volume under the plane over the disk bounded by the circle with equation .    The bounds of the integral are determined solely by the region over which we are integrating. In this case, it is a disk with boundary . We need to find polar bounds for this region. It may help to review Section ; bounds for this disk are and .  We replace with . That means we make the following substitutions: .  Finally, we replace in the double integral with . This gives the final iterated integral, which we evaluate: .   Evaluating a double integral with polar coordinates in Example         The surface and region are shown in Figure .     Two simple examples of double integrals in polar coordinates     Evaluating a double integral with polar coordinates   Find the volume under the paraboloid over the region bounded by the circles and .    At first glance, this seems like a very hard volume to compute as the region (shown in Figure ) has a hole in it, cutting out a strange portion of the surface, as shown in Figure . However, by describing in terms of polar equations, the volume is not very difficult to compute.   Showing the region and surface used in Example                       It is straightforward to show that the circle has polar equation , and that the circle has polar equation . Each of these circles is traced out on the interval . The bounds on are .  Replacing with in the integrand, along with replacing with , prepares us to evaluate the double integral : To integrate , rewrite it as and employ the power-reducing formula twice: . Picking up from where we left off above, we have .  While this example was not trivial, the double integral would have been much harder to evaluate had we used rectangular coordinates.     Evaluating a double integral with polar coordinates   Find the volume under the surface over the sector of the circle with radius centered at the origin in the first quadrant, as shown in Figure .   The surface and region used in Example           The region we are integrating over is a circle with radius , restricted to the first quadrant. Thus, in polar, the bounds on are , . The integrand is rewritten in polar as .  We find the volume as follows: .   Previous work has shown that there is finite area under over the entire -axis. However, Example shows that there is infinite volume under over the entire -plane.    Figure shows that shrinks to near 0 very quickly. Regardless, as grows, so does the volume, without bound.     Finding the volume of a sphere   Find the volume of a sphere with radius .    The sphere of radius , centered at the origin, has equation ; solving for , we have . This gives the upper half of a sphere. We wish to find the volume under this top half, then double it to find the total volume.  The region we need to integrate over is the disk of radius , centered at the origin. Polar bounds for this equation are , .  All together, the volume of a sphere with radius is: .  Generally, the formula for the volume of a sphere with radius is given as ; we have justified this formula with our calculation.     Finding the volume bounded by two surfaces     Finding the volume of a solid   A sculptor wants to make a solid bronze cast of the solid shown in Figure , where the base of the solid has boundary, in polar coordinates, , and the top is defined by the plane . Find the volume of the solid.   Visualizing the solid used in Example           From the outset, we should recognize that knowing how to set up this problem is probably more important than knowing how to compute the integrals. The iterated integral to come is not hard to evaluate, though it is long, requiring lots of algebra. Once the proper iterated integral is determined, one can use readily available technology to help compute the final answer.  The region that we are integrating over is bound by , for (note that this rose curve is traced out on the interval , not ). This gives us our bounds of integration. The integrand is ; converting to polar, we have that the volume is: .  Distributing the , the inner integral is easy to evaluate, leading to .  This integral takes time to compute by hand; it is rather long and cumbersome. The powers of cosine need to be reduced, and products like need to be turned to sums using the Product To Sum formulas in the back cover of this text.  We rewrite as . We can also rewrite as: .  This last expression still needs simplification, but eventually all terms can be reduced to the form or for various values of and .  We forgo the algebra and recommend the reader employ technology, such as WolframAlpha , to compute the numeric answer. Such technology gives: .  Since the units were not specified, we leave the result as almost cubic units (meters, feet, etc.) Should the artist want to scale the piece uniformly, so that each rose petal had a length other than 1, she should keep in mind that scaling by a factor of scales the volume by a factor of .     Another integral over a rose curve    We have used iterated integrals to find areas of plane regions and volumes under surfaces. Just as a single integral can be used to compute much more than area under the curve, iterated integrals can be used to compute much more than we have thus far seen. The next two sections show two, among many, applications of iterated integrals.    Terms and Concepts   When evaluating using polar coordinates, is replaced with and is replaced with .    ,     Why would one be interested in evaluating a double integral with polar coordinates?   Some regions in the -plane are easier to describe using polar coordinates than using rectangular coordinates. Also, some integrals are easier to evaluate one the polar substitutions have been made.     Problems    A function is given and a region of the -plane is described. Set up and evaluate using polar coordinates.     and is the region enclosed by the circle              ; is the region enclosed by the circle .         and is the region enclosed by the circles with polar equations and              ; is the region enclosed by the petal of the rose curve in the first quadrant.         ; is the annulus enclosed by the circles and .         and is the region enclosed by the circle              ; is the region enclosed by the circle in the first and fourth quadrants.         ; is the region enclosed by the lines , and the circle in the first quadrant.          An iterated integral in rectangular coordinates is given. Rewrite the integral using polar coordinates and evaluate the new double integral.                                       Hint: draw the region of each integral carefully and see how they all connect.          In the following exercises, special double integrals are presented that are especially well suited for evaluation in polar coordinates.    Consider .     Why is this integral difficult to evaluate in rectangular coordinates, regardless of the region ?    Let be the region bounded by the circle of radius centered at the origin. Evaluate the double integral using polar coordinates.    Take the limit of your answer from (b), as . What does this imply about the volume under the surface of over the entire -plane?         This is impossible to integrate with rectangular coordinates as does not have an antiderivative in terms of elementary functions.     .     . This implies that there is a finite volume under the surface over the entire -plane.       The surface of a right circular cone with height and base radius can be described by the equation , where the tip of the cone lies at and the circular base lies in the -plane, centered at the origin.  Confirm that the volume of a right circular cone with height and base radius is by evaluating in polar coordinates.    .      "

  "body": " Center of Mass   We have used iterated integrals to find areas of plane regions and signed volumes under surfaces. A brief recap of these uses will be useful in this section as we apply iterated integrals to compute the mass and center of mass of planar regions.  To find the area of a planar region, we evaluated the double integral . That is, summing up the areas of lots of little subregions of gave us the total area. Informally, we think of as meaning sum up lots of little areas over .   To find the signed volume under a surface, we evaluated the double integral . Recall that the is not just a bookend at the end of an integral; rather, it is multiplied by . We regard as giving a height, and still giving an area: gives a volume. Thus, informally, means sum up lots of little volumes over .   We now extend these ideas to other contexts.    Mass and Weight  Consider a thin sheet of material with constant thickness and finite area. Mathematicians (and physicists and engineers) call such a sheet a lamina . So consider a lamina, as shown in Figure , with the shape of some planar region , as shown in Figure . lamina  mass    Illustrating the concept of a lamina                       We can write a simple double integral that represents the mass of the lamina: , where means a little mass. That is, the double integral states the total mass of the lamina can be found by summing up lots of little masses over .   To evaluate this double integral, partition into subregions as we have done in the past. The th subregion has area . A fundamental property of mass is that mass=density area. If the lamina has a constant density , then the mass of this th subregion is . That is, we can compute a small amount of mass by multiplying a small amount of area by the density.  If density is variable, with density function , then we can approximate the mass of the th subregion of by multiplying by , where is a point in that subregion. That is, for a small enough subregion of , the density across that region is almost constant.    Mass and weight are different measures. Since they are scalar multiples of each other, it is often easy to treat them as the same measure. In this section we effectively treat them as the same, as our technique for finding mass is the same as for finding weight. The density functions used will simply have different units.   The total mass of the lamina is approximately the sum of approximate masses of subregions: .  Taking the limit as the size of the subregions shrinks to 0 gives us the actual mass; that is, integrating over gives the mass of the lamina.   Mass of a Lamina with Variable Density   Let be a continuous density function of a lamina corresponding to a closed, bounded plane region . The mass of the lamina is mass  .      Finding the mass of a lamina with constant density   Find the mass of a square lamina, with side length 1, with a density of .    We represent the lamina with a square region in the plane as shown in Figure . As the density is constant, it does not matter where we place the square.   A region representing a lamina in Example         Following Definition , the mass of the lamina is .  This is all very straightforward; note that all we really did was find the area of the lamina and multiply it by the constant density of 3 .     Finding the mass of a lamina with variable density   Find the mass of a square lamina, represented by the unit square with lower lefthand corner at the origin (see Figure ), with variable density .   Graphing the density functions in Examples and           The variable density , in this example, is very uniform, giving a density of 3 in the center of the square and changing linearly. A graph of can be seen in Figure ; notice how same amount of density is above as below. We'll comment on the significance of this momentarily.  The mass is found by integrating over . The order of integration is not important; we choose arbitrarily. Thus: .  It turns out that since the density of the lamina is so uniformly distributed above and below  that the mass of the lamina is the same as if it had a constant density of 3. The density functions in Examples and are graphed in Figure , which illustrates this concept.     Finding the weight of a lamina with variable density   Find the weight of the lamina represented by the disk with radius 2 , centered at the origin, with density function . Compare this to the weight of the lamina with the same shape and density .    A direct application of Definition states that the weight of the lamina is . Since our lamina is in the shape of a circle, it makes sense to approach the double integral using polar coordinates.  The density function becomes . The circle is bounded by and . Thus the weight is: .  Now compare this with the density function . Converting this to polar coordinates gives . Thus the weight is: .  One would expect different density functions to return different weights, as we have here. The density functions were chosen, though, to be similar: each gives a density of 1 at the origin and a density of 5 at the outside edge of the circle, as seen in Figure .   Graphing the density functions in Example . In (a) is the density function ; in (b) is                       Notice how over the circle; this results in less weight.    Plotting the density functions can be useful as our understanding of mass can be related to our understanding of volume under a surface. We interpreted as giving the volume under over ; we can understand in the same way. The volume under over is actually mass; by compressing the volume under onto the -plane, we get more mass in some areas than others  , areas of greater density.  Knowing the mass of a lamina is one of several important measures. Another is the center of mass , which we discuss next.    Center of Mass  Consider a disk of radius 1 with uniform density. It is common knowledge that the disk will balance on a point if the point is placed at the center of the disk. What if the disk does not have a uniform density? Through trial-and-error, we should still be able to find a spot on the disk at which the disk will balance on a point. This balance point is referred to as the center of mass , or center of gravity . It is though all the mass is centered there. In fact, if the disk has a mass of 3 , the disk will behave physically as though it were a point-mass of 3 located at its center of mass. For instance, the disk will naturally spin with an axis through its center of mass (which is why it is important to balance the tires of your car: if they are out of balance , their center of mass will be outside of the axle and it will shake terribly). center of mass  mass center of   We find the center of mass based on the principle of a weighted average . Consider a college class in which your homework average is 90%, your test average is 73%, and your final exam grade is an 85%. Experience tells us that our final grade is not the average of these three grades: that is, it is not: .  That is, you are probably not pulling a B in the course. Rather, your grades are weighted . Let's say the homework is worth 10% of the grade, tests are 60% and the exam is 30%. Then your final grade is: .  Each grade is multiplied by a weight .  In general, given values and weights , the weighted average of the values is .  In the grading example above, the sum of the weights 0.1, 0.6 and 0.3 is 1, so we don't see the division by the sum of weights in that instance.  How this relates to center of mass is given in the following theorem.   Center of Mass of Discrete Linear System   Let point masses be distributed along the -axis at locations , respectively. The center of mass of the system is located at center of mass  .     Finding the center of mass of a discrete linear system      Point masses of 2 are located at , and are connected by a thin rod of negligible weight. Find the center of mass of the system.    Point masses of 10 , 2 and 1 are located at , and , respectively, are connected by a thin rod of negligible weight. Find the center of mass of the system.          Following Theorem , we compute the center of mass as: . So the system would balance on a point placed at , as illustrated in Figure .   Illustrating point masses along a thin rod and the center of mass                         Again following Theorem , we find: . Placing a large weight at the left hand side of the system moves the center of mass left, as shown in Figure .       In a discrete system ( , mass is located at individual points, not along a continuum) we find the center of mass by dividing the mass into a moment of the system. In general, a moment is a weighted measure of distance from a particular point or line. In the case described by Theorem , we are finding a weighted measure of distances from the -axis, so we refer to this as the moment about the -axis , represented by . Letting be the total mass of the system, we have .  We can extend the concept of the center of mass of discrete points along a line to the center of mass of discrete points in the plane rather easily. To do so, we define some terms then give a theorem.   Moments about the and Axes   Let point masses , be located at points , respectively, in the -plane. moment      The moment about the -axis , , is .    The moment about the -axis , , is .       One can think that these definitions are backwards as sums up distances. But remember, distances are measurements of distance from the -axis, hence defining the moment about the -axis.  We now define the center of mass of discrete points in the plane.   Center of Mass of Discrete Planar System   Let point masses , be located at points , respectively, in the -plane, and let . center of mass   The center of mass of the system is at , where .     Finding the center of mass of a discrete planar system   Let point masses of 1 , 2 and 5 be located at points , and , respectively, and are connected by thin rods of negligible weight. Find the center of mass of the system.    We follow Theorem and Definition to find , and :   .    .   .    Illustrating the center of mass of a discrete planar system in Example         Thus the center of mass is , illustrated in Figure .    We finally arrive at our true goal of this section: finding the center of mass of a lamina with variable density. While the above measurement of center of mass is interesting, it does not directly answer more realistic situations where we need to find the center of mass of a contiguous region. However, understanding the discrete case allows us to approximate the center of mass of a planar lamina; using calculus, we can refine the approximation to an exact value.  We begin by representing a planar lamina with a region in the -plane with density function . Partition into subdivisions, each with area . As done before, we can approximate the mass of the th subregion with , where is a point inside the th subregion. We can approximate the moment of this subregion about the -axis with  that is, by multiplying the approximate mass of the region by its approximate distance from the -axis. Similarly, we can approximate the moment about the -axis with . By summing over all subregions, we have:   By taking limits, where size of each subregion shrinks to 0 in both the and directions, we arrive at the double integrals given in the following theorem.   Center of Mass of a Planar Lamina, Moments   Let a planar lamina be represented by a closed, bounded region in the -plane with density function . center of mass  moment                     The center of mass of the lamina is .       We start our practice of finding centers of mass by revisiting some of the lamina used previously in this section when finding mass. We will just set up the integrals needed to compute , and and leave the details of the integration to the reader.   Finding the center of mass of a lamina   Find the center mass of a square lamina, with side length 1, with a density of . (Note: this is the lamina from Example .)    We represent the lamina with a square region in the plane as shown in Figure as done previously.   A region representing a lamina in Example         Following Theorem , we find , and : .  Thus the center of mass is . This is what we should have expected: the center of mass of a square with constant density is the center of the square.     Finding the center of mass of a lamina   Find the center of mass of a square lamina, represented by the unit square with lower lefthand corner at the origin (see Figure ), with variable density . (Note: this is the lamina from Example .)    We follow Theorem , to find , and : .  Thus the center of mass is . While the mass of this lamina is the same as the lamina in the previous example, the greater density found with greater and values pulls the center of mass from the center slightly towards the upper righthand corner.     Finding the center of mass of a lamina   Find the center of mass of the lamina represented by the circle with radius 2 , centered at the origin, with density function . (Note: this is one of the lamina used in Example .)    As done in Example , it is best to describe using polar coordinates. Thus when we compute , we will integrate not , but rather . We compute , and : .  Since and the density of are both symmetric about the and axes, it should come as no big surprise that the moments about each axis is 0. Thus the center of mass is .     Finding the center of mass of a lamina   Find the center of mass of the lamina represented by the region shown in Figure , half an annulus with outer radius 6 and inner radius 5 , with constant density 2 .   Illustrating the region in Example           Once again it will be useful to represent in polar coordinates. Using the description of and\/or the illustration, we see that is bounded by and . As the lamina is symmetric about the -axis, we should expect . We compute , and : .  Thus the center of mass is . The center of mass is indicated in Figure ; note how it lies outside of !    This section has shown us another use for iterated integrals beyond finding area or signed volume under the curve. While there are many uses for iterated integrals, we give one more application in the following section: computing surface area.     Terms and Concepts   Why is it easy to use mass and weight interchangeably, even though they are different measures?   Because they are scalar multiples of each other.    Given a point , the value of is a measure of distance from the -axis.        We can think of as meaning sum up lots of     little masses     What is a discrete planar system?    A collection of individual masses in the plane. Each mass is a point mass, , mass located at a point, not across a region.    Why does use instead of ; that is, why do we use and not ?    measures the moment about the -axis, meaning we need to measure distance from the -axis. Such measurements are measures in the -direction.    Describe a situation where the center of mass of a lamina does not lie within the region of the lamina itself.   If the lamina is an annulus, the center of mass will likely be in the middle, outside of the region. (See Example .)     Problems    In the following exercises, point masses are given along a line or in the plane. Find the center of mass or , as appropriate.

  "title": "Surface Area",
  "body": " Surface Area  In Section we used definite integrals to compute the arc length of plane curves of the form . We later extended these ideas to compute the arc length of plane curves defined by parametric or polar equations.  The natural extension of the concept of arc length over an interval to surfaces is surface area over a region.   Consider the surface over a region in the -plane, shown in Figure . Because of the domed shape of the surface, the surface area will be greater than that of the area of the region . We can find this area using the same basic technique we have used over and over: we'll make an approximation, then using limits, we'll refine the approximation to the exact value.   Developing a method of computing surface area                       As done to find the volume under a surface or the mass of a lamina, we subdivide into subregions. Here we subdivide into rectangles, as shown in the figure. One such subregion is outlined in the figure, where the rectangle has dimensions and , along with its corresponding region on the surface.  In part Figure of the figure, we zoom in on this portion of the surface. When and are small, the function is approximated well by the tangent plane at any point in this subregion, which is graphed in part Figure . In fact, the tangent plane approximates the function so well that in this figure, it is virtually indistinguishable from the surface itself! Therefore we can approximate the surface area of this region of the surface with the area of the corresponding portion of the tangent plane.  This portion of the tangent plane is a parallelogram, defined by sides and , as shown. One of the applications of the cross product from Section is that the area of this parallelogram is . Once we can determine and , we can determine the area.  The vector is tangent to the surface in the direction of , therefore, from Section , is parallel to . The -displacement of is , so we know that . Similar logic shows that . Thus: .  Note that , the area of the th subregion.  Summing up all of the approximations to the surface area gives .  Once again take a limit as all of the and shrink to 0; this leads to a double integral.   Surface Area   Let where and are continuous over a closed, bounded region . The surface area over is surface area  .     As done before, we think of as meaning sum up lots of little surface areas over .   The concept of surface area is defined here, for while we already have a notion of the area of a region in the plane , we did not yet have a solid grasp of what the area of a surface in space means.   We test this definition by using it to compute surface areas of known surfaces. We start with a triangle.   Finding the surface area of a plane over a triangle   Let , and let be the region in the plane bounded by , and , as shown in Figure . Find the surface area of over .   Finding the area of a triangle in space in Example           We follow Definition . We start by noting that and . To define , we use bounds and . Therefore .  Because the surface is a triangle, we can figure out the area using geometry. Considering the base of the triangle to be the side in the -plane, we find the length of the base to be . We can find the height using our knowledge of vectors: let be the side in the -plane and let be the side in the -plane. The height is then . Geometry states that the area is thus .  We affirm the validity of our formula.    It is common knowledge that the surface area of a sphere of radius is . We confirm this in the following example, which involves using our formula with polar coordinates.   The surface area of a sphere   Find the surface area of the sphere with radius centered at the origin, whose top hemisphere has equation .    We start by computing partial derivatives and find .  As our function only defines the top upper hemisphere of the sphere, we double our surface area result to get the total area: .  The region that we are integrating over is bounded by the circle, centered at the origin, with radius : . Because of this region, we are likely to have greater success with our integration by converting to polar coordinates. Using the substitutions , , and bounds and , we have: .  Our work confirms our previous formula.     The inner integral in Equation is an improper integral, as the integrand of is not defined at . To properly evaluate this integral, one must use the techniques of Section .  The reason this need arises is that the function fails the requirements of Definition , as and are not continuous on the boundary of the circle .  The computation of the surface area is still valid. The definition makes stronger requirements than necessary in part to avoid the use of improper integration, as when and\/or are not continuous, the resulting improper integral may not converge. Since the improper integral does converge in this example, the surface area is accurately computed.    Finding the surface area of a cone   The general formula for a right cone with height and base radius is , shown in Figure . Find the surface area of this cone.   Finding the surface area of a cone in Example           We begin by computing partial derivatives. .  Since we are integrating over the disk bounded by , we again use polar coordinates. Using the standard substitutions, our integrand becomes .  This may look intimidating at first, but there are lots of simple simplifications to be done. It amazingly reduces to just .  Our polar bounds are and . Thus .  This matches the formula found in the back of this text.   Note that once again and are not continuous on the domain of , as both are undefined at . (A similar problem occurred in the previous example.) Once again the resulting improper integral converges and the computation of the surface area is valid.      Finding surface area over a region   Find the area of the surface over the region bounded by , , as pictured in Figure .   Graphing the surface in Example           It is straightforward to compute and . Thus the surface area is described by the double integral .  As with integrals describing arc length, double integrals describing surface area are in general hard to evaluate directly because of the square-root. This particular integral can be easily evaluated, though, with judicious choice of our order of integration.  Integrating with order requires us to evaluate . This can be done, though it involves Integration By Parts and . Integrating with order has as its first integral , which is easy to evaluate: it is simply . So we proceed with the order ; the bounds are already given in the statement of the problem. .  So while the region over which we integrate has an area of 16 square units, the surface has a much greater area as its -values change dramatically over .    In practice, technology helps greatly in the evaluation of such integrals. High powered computer algebra systems can compute integrals that are difficult, or at least time consuming, by hand, and can at the least produce very accurate approximations with numerical methods. In general, just knowing how to set up the proper integrals brings one very close to being able to compute the needed value. Most of the work is actually done in just describing the region in terms of polar or rectangular coordinates. Once this is done, technology can usually provide a good answer.  We have learned how to integrate integrals; that is, we have learned to evaluate double integrals. In the next section, we learn how to integrate double integrals that is, we learn to evaluate triple integrals , along with learning some uses for this operation.    Terms and Concepts    Surface area is analogous to what previously studied concept?   arc length    To approximate the area of a small portion of a surface, we computed the area of its plane.   tangent    We interpret as sum up lots of little  .    surface areas    Why is it important to know how to set up a double integral to compute surface area, even if the resulting integral is hard to evaluate?   Technology makes good approximations accessible, if not exact answers.    Why do and , for some real number , have the same surface area over a region ?   Intuitively, adding to only shifts up ( , parallel to the -axis) and does not change its shape. Therefore it will not change the surface area over .  Analytically, and ; therefore, the surface area of each is computed with identical double integrals.    Let and . Why is the surface area of over a region not twice the surface area of over ?   Analytically, and . The double integral to compute the surface area of over is ; the double integral to compute the surface area of over is , which is not twice the double integral used to calculate the surface area of .

This is easier in polar:     Find the surface area of the sphere with radius 5 by doubling the surface area of over the region bounded by the circle . (Be sure to compare your result with the known formula.)   This is easier in polar:     Find the surface area of the ellipse formed by restricting the plane to the region bounded by the circle , where , and are some constants.

The value of does not matter as it only shifts the plane vertically ( , parallel to the -axis). Different values of do not create different ellipses in the plane.      "

Just as our first introduction to double integrals was in the context of finding the area of a plane region, our introduction into triple integrals will be in the context of finding the volume of a space region.   Approximating the volume of a region in space                       To formally find the volume of a closed, bounded region in space, such as the one shown in Figure , we start with an approximation. Break into rectangular solids; the solids near the boundary of may possibly not include portions of and\/or include extra space. In Figure , we zoom in on a portion of the boundary of to show a rectangular solid that contains space not in ; as this is an approximation of the volume, this is acceptable and this error will be reduced as we shrink the size of our solids.  The volume of the th solid is , where , and give the dimensions of the rectangular solid in the , and directions, respectively. By summing up the volumes of all solids, we get an approximation of the volume of : .  Let represent the length of the longest diagonal of rectangular solids in the subdivision of . As , the volume of each solid goes to 0, as do each of , and , for all . Our calculus experience tells us that taking a limit as turns our approximation of into an exact calculation of . Before we state this result in a theorem, we use a definition to define some terms.   Triple Integrals, Iterated Integration (Part I)   Let be a closed, bounded region in space. Let and be real numbers, let and be continuous functions of , and let and be continuous functions of and . integration triple  triple integral  iterated integration      The volume of is denoted by a triple integral , .    The iterated integral is evaluated as . Evaluating the above iterated integral is triple integration.        Our informal understanding of the notation is sum up lots of little volumes over , analogous to our understanding of and .   Introducing the triple integral    We now state the major theorem of this section.   Triple Integration (Part I)   Let be a closed, bounded region in space and let be any subdivision of into rectangular solids, where the th subregion has dimensions and volume . integration triple  triple integral  iterated integration      The volume of is .    If is defined as the region bounded by the planes and , the cylinders and , and the surfaces and , where , and on , then .     can be determined using iterated integration with other orders of integration (there are 6 total), as long as is defined by the region enclosed by a pair of planes, a pair of cylinders, and a pair of surfaces.       We evaluated the area of a plane region by iterated integration, where the bounds were from curve to curve, then from point to point.  Theorem allows us to find the volume of a space region with an iterated integral with bounds from surface to surface, then from curve to curve, then from point to point. In the iterated integral , the bounds and define a region in the -plane over which the region exists in space. However, these bounds are also defining surfaces in space; is a plane and is a cylinder. The combination of these 6 surfaces enclose, and define, .    Example uses the term first octant. Recall how the -, - and -axes divide space into eight octants ; the octant in which , and are all positive is called the first octant .   Examples will help us understand triple integration, including integrating with various orders of integration.   Finding the volume of a tetrahedron     Finding the volume of a space region with triple integration   Find the volume of the space region in the first octant bounded by the plane , shown in Figure , using the order of integration . Set up the triple integrals that give the volume in the other 5 orders of integration.   The region used in Example           Starting with the order of integration , we need to first find bounds on . The region is bounded below by the plane (because we are restricted to the first octant) and above by ; .  To find the bounds on and , we collapse the region onto the -plane, giving the triangle shown in Figure . (We know the equation of the line in two ways. First, by setting , we have . Secondly, we know this is going to be a straight line between the points and in the -plane.)   The region found by collapsing onto the -plane         We define that region , in the integration order of , with bounds and . Thus the volume of the region is: . From this step on, we are evaluating a double integral as done many times before. We skip these steps and give the final volume, .  The order :  Now consider the volume using the order of integration . The bounds on are the same as before, . Collapsing the space region on the -plane as shown in Figure , we now describe this triangle with the order of integration . This gives bounds and . Thus the volume is given by the triple integral .  The order :  Following our surface to surface strategy, we need to determine the - surfaces that bound our space region. To do so, approach the region from behind, in the direction of increasing . The first surface we hit as we enter the region is the -plane, defined by . We come out of the region at the plane ; solving for , we have . Thus the bounds on are: .  Now collapse the space region onto the -plane, as shown in Figure . (Again, we find the equation of the line by setting in the equation .) We need to find bounds on this region with the order . The curves that bound are and ; the points that bound are 0 and 2. Thus the triple integral giving volume is:          .   The order :   The region in Example is collapsed onto the -plane in (a); in (b), the region is collapsed onto the -plane                       The -bounds are the same as the order above. We now consider the triangle in Figure and describe it with the order : and . Thus the volume is given by:          .   The order :  We now need to determine the -surfaces that determine our region. Approaching the space region from behind and moving in the direction of increasing , we first enter the region at , and exit along the plane . Solving for , this plane has equation . Thus has bounds .  Now collapse the region onto the -plane, as shown in Figure . The curves bounding this triangle are and ; is bounded by the points to . Thus the triple integral giving volume is:          .   The order :  The -bounds are the same as in the order above. We now determine the bounds of the triangle in Figure using the order . is bounded by and ; is bounded between and . This leads to the triple integral:          .   This problem was long, but hopefully useful, demonstrating how to determine bounds with every order of integration to describe the region . In practice, we only need 1, but being able to do them all gives us flexibility to choose the order that suits us best.    In the previous example, we collapsed the surface into the - , - , and -planes as we determined the curve to curve, point to point bounds of integration. Since the surface was a triangular portion of a plane, this collapsing, or projecting , was simple: the projection of a straight line in space onto a coordinate plane is a line.  The following example shows us how to do this when dealing with more complicated surfaces and curves.   Finding the projection of a curve in space onto the coordinate planes   Consider the surfaces and , as shown in Figure . The curve of their intersection is shown, along with the projection of this curve into the coordinate planes, shown dashed. Find the equations of the projections into the coordinate planes.   Finding the projections of the curve of intersection in Example                         The two surfaces are and . To find where they intersect, it is natural to set them equal to each other: . This is an implicit function of and that gives all points in the -plane where the values of the two surfaces are equal.  We can rewrite this implicit function by completing the square: .  Thus in the -plane the projection of the intersection is a circle with radius 2, centered at .  To project onto the -plane, we do a similar procedure: find the and values where the values on the surface are the same. We start by solving the equation of each surface for . In this particular case, it works well to actually solve for :      .  Thus we have (after again completing the square): , and ellipse centered at in the -plane with a major axis of length 8 and a minor axis of length 4.  Finally, to project the curve of intersection into the -plane, we solve equation for . Since is a cylinder that lacks the variable , it becomes our equation of the projection in the -plane.  All three projections are shown in Figure .     Changing the order of integration in a triple integral     Finding the volume of a space region with triple integration   Set up the triple integrals that find the volume of the space region bounded by the surfaces , and , as shown in Figure , with the orders of integration , and .   The region in Example is shown in (a); in (b), it is collapsed onto the -plane                         The order :  The region is bounded below by the plane and above by the plane . The cylinder does not offer any bounds in the -direction, as that surface is parallel to the -axis. Thus .  Collapsing the region into the -plane, we get part of the circle with equation as shown in Figure . As a function of , this half circle has equation . Thus is bounded below by and above by : . The bounds of the half circle are . All together, the bounds of integration and triple integral are as follows:          .   We evaluate this triple integral: .  With the order :  The region is bounded below in the -direction by the surface and above by the surface . Thus the bounds are .  Collapsing the region onto the -plane gives the region shown in Figure ; this half disk is bounded by and . (We find this curve by solving each surface for , then setting them equal to each other. We have and . Thus .) It is bounded below by and above by , where is bounded by . All together, we have:          .    The region in Example is shown collapsed onto the -plane in (a); in (b), it is collapsed onto the -plane                       With the order :   is bounded below by the surface and above by . We then collapse the region onto the -plane and get the triangle shown in Figure . (The hypotenuse is the line , just as the plane.) Thus is bounded by and is bounded by . This gives:          .     The following theorem states two things that should make common sense to us. First, using the triple integral to find volume of a region should always return a positive number; we are computing volume here, not signed volume . Secondly, to compute the volume of a complicated region, we could break it up into subregions and compute the volumes of each subregion separately, summing them later to find the total volume.   Properties of Triple Integrals   Let be a closed, bounded region in space, and let and be non-overlapping regions such that . triple integral properties  iterated integration properties            .       We use this latter property in the next example.   Finding the volume of a space region with triple integration   Find the volume of the space region bounded by the coordinate planes, and , as shown in Figure . Set up the triple integrals that find the volume of in all 6 orders of integration.   The region in Example is shown in (a); in (b), it is collapsed onto the -plane                         Following the bounds-determining strategy of surface to surface, curve to curve, and point to point, we can see that the most difficult orders of integration are the two in which we integrate with respect to first, for there are two upper surfaces that bound in the -direction. So we start by noting that we have .  We now collapse the region onto the -axis, as shown in Figure . The boundary of , the line from to , is shown in Figure as a dashed line; it has equation . (We can recognize this in two ways: one, in collapsing the line from to onto the -plane, we simply ignore the -values, meaning the line now goes from to . Secondly, the two surfaces meet where is equal to : thus .)  We use the second property of Theorem to state that , where and are the space regions above the plane regions and , respectively. Thus we can say .  All that is left is to determine bounds of and , depending on whether we are integrating with order or . We give the final integrals here, leaving it to the reader to confirm these results.   :      :     The remaining four orders of integration do not require a sum of triple integrals. In Figure we show collapsed onto the other two coordinate planes. Using these graphs, we give the final orders of integration here, again leaving it to the reader to confirm these results.   The region in Example is shown collapsed onto the -plane in (a); in (b), it is collapsed onto the -plane                        :          .    :          .    :          .    :          .     We give one more example of finding the volume of a space region.   Finding the volume of a space region   Set up a triple integral that gives the volume of the space region bounded by and . These surfaces are plotted in Figure and Figure , respectively; the region is shown in Figure .   The region is bounded by the surfaces shown in (a) and (b); is shown in (c)                                  The main point of this example is this: integrating with respect to first is rather straightforward; integrating with respect to first is not.  The order :  The bounds on are clearly . Collapsing onto the -plane gives the ellipse shown in Figure . The equation of this ellipse is found by setting the two surfaces equal to each other: .  We can describe this ellipse with the bounds .  Thus we find volume as          .   The order :  Integrating with respect to is not too difficult. Since the surface is a cylinder whose directrix is the -axis, it does not create a border for . The paraboloid does; solving for , we get the bounds .  Collapsing onto the -plane gives the region shown in Figure ; the lower curve is from the cylinder, with equation . The upper curve is from the paraboloid; with , the curve is . Thus bounds on are ; the bounds on are . Thus we have:          .    The region in Example is collapsed onto the -plane in (a); in (b), it is collapsed onto the -plane                       The order :  This order takes more effort as must be split into two subregions. The two surfaces create two sets of upper\/lower bounds in terms of ; the cylinder creates bounds for region and the paraboloid creates bounds for region .  Collapsing onto the -axes gives the regions shown in Figure . We find the equation of the curve by noting that the equation of the ellipse seen in Figure has equation .  Substitute this expression for in either surface equation, or . In both cases, we find .  Region , corresponding to , has bounds and region , corresponding to , has bounds .  Thus the volume of is given by: .    If all one wanted to do in Example was find the volume of the region , one would have likely stopped at the first integration setup (with order ) and computed the volume from there. However, we included the other two methods 1) to show that it could be done, messy or not, and 2) because sometimes we have to use a less desirable order of integration in order to actually integrate.    Triple Integration and Functions of Three Variables  There are uses for triple integration beyond merely finding volume, just as there are uses for integration beyond area under the curve. These uses start with understanding how to integrate functions of three variables, which is effectively no different than integrating functions of two variables. This leads us to a definition, followed by an example.   Iterated Integration, (Part II)   Let be a closed, bounded region in space, over which , , , and are all continuous, and let and be real numbers.  The iterated integral  is evaluated as integration triple  triple integral  iterated integration  .     Evaluating a triple integral of a function of three variables   Evaluate .    We evaluate this integral according to Definition .   .  We continue as we have in the past, showing fewer steps. .    We now know how to evaluate a triple integral of a function of three variables; we do not yet understand what it means . We build up this understanding in a way very similar to how we have understood integration and double integration.  Let be a continuous function of three variables, defined over some space region . We can partition into rectangular-solid subregions, each with dimensions . Let be some point in the th subregion, and consider the product . It is the product of a function value (that's the part) and a small volume (that's the part). One of the simplest understanding of this type of product is when describes the density of an object, for then .  We can sum up all products over . Again letting represent the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular solids in the partition, we can take the limit of the sums of products as . That is, we can find .  While this limit has lots of interpretations depending on the function , in the case where describes density, is the total mass of the object described by the region .  We now use the above limit to define the triple integral , give a theorem that relates triple integrals to iterated iteration, followed by the application of triple integrals to find the centers of mass of solid objects.   Triple Integral   Let be a continuous function over a closed, bounded region in space, and let be any partition of into rectangular solids with volume . The triple integral of over is integration triple  triple integral  iterated integration  .    The following theorem assures us that the above limit exists for continuous functions and gives us a method of evaluating the limit.   Triple Integration (Part II)   Let be a continuous function over a closed, bounded region in space, and let be any partition of into rectangular solids with volume . integration triple  triple integral  iterated integration    The limit exists.    If is defined as the region bounded by the planes and , the cylinders and , and the surfaces and , where , and on , then .         Note: In an aside in Section , we showed how the summation of rectangles over a region in the plane could be viewed as a double sum, leading to the double integral. Likewise, we can view the sum as a triple sum, , which we evaluate as .  Here we fix a value, which establishes the -height of the rectangular solids on one level of all the rectangular solids in the space region . The inner double summation adds up all the volumes of the rectangular solids on this level, while the outer summation adds up the volumes of each level.  This triple summation understanding leads to the notation of the triple integral, as well as the method of evaluation shown in Theorem .  We now apply triple integration to find the centers of mass of solid objects.    Mass and Center of Mass  One may wish to review Section for a reminder of the relevant terms and concepts.   Mass, Center of Mass of Solids   Let a solid be represented by a closed, bounded region in space with variable density function . moment  center of mass  mass      The mass of the object is .    The moment about the -plane is .    The moment about the -plane is .    The moment about the -plane is .    The center of mass of the object is .        Finding the center of mass of a solid   Find the mass and center of mass of the solid represented by the space region bounded by the coordinate planes and , shown in Figure , with constant density . (Note: this space region was used in Example .)   Finding the center of mass of this solid in Example           We apply Definition . In Example , we found bounds for the order of integration to be , and . We find the mass of the object: .  The evaluation of the triple integral is done in Example , so we skipped those steps above. Note how the mass of an object with constant density is simply density volume.   We now find the moments about the planes. .  We omit the steps of integrating to find the other moments. .  The center of mass is .     Finding the center of mass of a solid   Find the center of mass of the solid represented by the region bounded by the planes and and the cylinder , shown in Figure , with density function . (Note: this space region was used in Example .)   Finding the center of mass of this solid in Example           As we start, consider the density function. It is symmetric about the -plane, and the farther one moves from this plane, the denser the object is. The symmetry indicates that should be 0.  As one moves away from the origin in the or directions, the object becomes less dense, though there is more volume in these regions.  Though none of the integrals needed to compute the center of mass are particularly hard, they do require a number of steps. We emphasize here the importance of knowing how to set up the proper integrals; in complex situations we can appeal to technology for a good approximation, if not the exact answer. We use the order of integration , using the bounds found in Example . (As these are the same for all four triple integrals, we explicitly show the bounds only for .) .  Note how , as expected. The center of mass is .    As stated before, there are many uses for triple integration beyond finding volume. When describes a rate of change function over some space region , then gives the total change over . Our one specific example of this was computing mass; a density function is simply a rate of mass change per volume function. Integrating density gives total mass.  While knowing how to integrate is important, it is arguably much more important to know how to set up integrals. It takes skill to create a formula that describes a desired quantity; modern technology is very useful in evaluating these formulas quickly and accurately.  In Section , we learn about two new coordinate systems (each related to polar coordinates) that allow us to integrate over closed regions in space more easily than when using rectangular coordinates.     Terms and Concepts   The strategy for establishing bounds for triple integrals is to , to and to .   surface to surface, curve to curve and point to point    Give an informal interpretation of what means.   One possible answer is sum up lots of little volumes over .     Give two uses of triple integration.   Answers can vary. From this section we used triple integration to find the volume of a solid region, the mass of a solid, and the center of mass of a solid.    If an object has a constant density and a volume , what is its mass?    .     Problems    Two surfaces and and a region in the , plane are given.

The first surface we hit as we enter the region is the -plane, defined by . We come out of the region at the plane ; solving for , we have . Thus the bounds on are: .  Now collapse the space region onto the -plane, as shown in Figure . (Again, we find the equation of the line by setting in the equation .) We need to find bounds on this region with the order .

  "body": " Triple Integration with Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates   Just as polar coordinates gave us a new way of describing curves in the plane, in this section we will see how cylindrical and spherical coordinates give us new ways of desribing surfaces and regions in space.   Both coordinate systems provide ways of extending polar coordinates in the plane to three dimensions. The reader is warned that while conventions are fairly standard for cylindrical coordinates, there are many different conventions for spherical coordinates. Mathematics, physics, and engineering all use slightly different versions. The definition presented in this text also differs from the usual mathematical definition. Why add yet another competing standard? The definition we present is slightly easier to work with, and should also be more familiar, since it corresponds to the coordinate system of latitude and longitude used to describe locations on the Earth.    A triple integral that isn't easily performed in rectancular coordinates      Cylindrical Coordinates  In short, cylindrical coordinates can be thought of as a combination of the polar and rectangular coordinate systems. One can identify a point , given in rectangular coordinates, with the point , given in cylindrical coordinates, where the -value in both systems is the same, and the point in the -plane is identified with the polar point ; see Figure . So that each point in space that does not lie on the -axis is defined uniquely, we will restrict and . cylindrical coordinates  coordinates cylindrical    Illustrating the principles behind cylindrical coordinates       We use the identity along with the identities found in Key Idea to convert between the rectangular coordinate and the cylindrical coordinate , namely:    Our rectangular to polar conversion formulas used , allowing for negative values. Since we now restrict , we can use .   These identities, along with conversions related to spherical coordinates, are given later in Key Idea .   Explaining the cylindrical coordinate system     Converting between rectangular and cylindrical coordinates   Convert the rectangular point to cylindrical coordinates, and convert the cylindrical point to rectangular.    Following the identities given above (and, later in Key Idea ), we have . Using , we find . As we restrict to being between and , we set . Finally, , giving the cylindrical point .  In converting the cylindrical point to rectangular, we have , and , giving the rectangular point .    Setting each of , and equal to a constant defines a surface in space, as illustrated in the following example.   Canonical surfaces in cylindrical coordinates   Describe the surfaces , and , given in cylindrical coordinates.    The equation describes all points in space that are 1 unit away from the -axis. This surface is a tube or cylinder of radius 1, centered on the -axis, as graphed in Figure (which describes the cylinder in space).  The equation describes the plane formed by extending the line , as given by polar coordinates in the -plane, parallel to the -axis.  The equation describes the plane of all points in space that are 2 units above the -plane. This plane is the same as the plane described by in rectangular coordinates.   Graphing the canonical surfaces in cylindrical coordinates from Example       All three surfaces are graphed in Figure . Note how their intersection uniquely defines the point .    Cylindrical coordinates are useful when describing certain domains in space, allowing us to evaluate triple integrals over these domains more easily than if we used rectangular coordinates.   Theorem shows how to evaluate using rectangular coordinates. In that evaluation, we use (or one of the other five orders of integration). Recall how, in this order of integration, the bounds on are curve to curve and the bounds on are point to point : these bounds describe a region in the -plane. We could describe using polar coordinates as done in Section . In that section, we saw how we used instead of .  Considering the above thoughts, we have . We set bounds on as surface to surface as done in the previous section, and then use curve to curve and point to point bounds on and , respectively. Finally, using the identities given above, we change the integrand to .  This process should sound plausible; the following theorem states it is truly a way of evaluating a triple integral.   Triple Integration in Cylindrical Coordinates   Let be a continuous function on a closed, bounded region in space, bounded in cylindrical coordinates by , and . Then integration with cylindrical coordinates  .     Using cylindrical coordinates to find the volume of a cone     Evaluating a triple integral with cylindrical coordinates   Find the mass of the solid represented by the region in space bounded by , and the cylinder (as shown in Figure ), with density function , using a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates. Distances are measured in centimeters and density is measured in grams per cubic centimeter.   Visualizing the solid used in Example         We begin by describing this region of space with cylindrical coordinates. The plane is left unchanged; with the identity , we convert the hemisphere of radius 2 to the equation ; the cylinder is converted to , or, more simply, . We also convert the density function: .  To describe this solid with the bounds of a triple integral, we bound with ; we bound with ; we bound with .  Using Definition and Theorem , we have the mass of the solid is , where we leave the details of the remaining double integral to the reader.     Finding the center of mass using cylindrical coordinates   Find the center of mass of the solid with constant density whose base can be described by the polar curve and whose top is defined by the plane , where distances are measured in feet, as seen in Figure . (The volume of this solid was found in Example .)   Visualizing the solid used in Example         We convert the equation of the plane to use cylindrical coordinates: . Thus the region is space is bounded by , , (recall that the rose curve is traced out once on .  Since density is constant, we set and finding the mass is equivalent to finding the volume of the solid. We set up the triple integral to compute this but do not evaluate it; we leave it to the reader to confirm it evaluates to the same result found in Example . .  From Definition we set up the triple integrals to compute the moments about the three coordinate planes. The computation of each is left to the reader (using technology is recommended): . .  The center of mass, in rectangular coordinates, is located at , which lies outside the bounds of the solid.      Spherical Coordinates   spherical coordinates  coordinates spherical   In short, spherical coordinates can be thought of as a double application of the polar coordinate system. In spherical coordinates, a point is identified with , where is the distance from the origin to , is the same angle as would be used to describe in the cylindrical coordinate system, and is the angle between the -plane and the ray from the origin to ; see Figure . So that each point in space that does not lie on the -axis is defined uniquely, we will restrict , and .   The symbol is the Greek letter rho. Traditionally it is used in the spherical coordinate system, while is used in the polar and cylindrical coordinate systems.    Note that most mathematics textbooks define to be measured from the positive -axis, with values in , rather than from the -plane.  We have chosen our convention with a number of considerations in mind:   The coordinates form a right-handed coordinate system: one in which the orientation matches that of our usual coordinates, where the right-hand rule applies. If is measured from the -axis, the order is needed to get a right-handed system.    Points of the form are the same in both cylindrical and spherical coordinates.    Some integration problems become slightly easier: we will see soon that the volume element in spherical coordinates involves , which integrates to . In the usual convention, the volume element involves , which integrates to  a source of many common sign errors.     Students of Physics will encounter yet another convention. In Physics, the variable is preferred as the radial coordinate, and spherical coordinates are given as ; however, in Physics, becomes the angle in the -plane, while is the angle measured from the positive -axis.  Note that the angle in the -plane ( , in our case) is known as the azimuthal angle . Our angle is known as the elevation angle . The angle used in other conventions that is measured from the positive -axis (often identified with the north pole) is known as the polar angle . For further discussion, the Wikipedia article is quite useful.    Illustrating the principles behind spherical coordinates        Introducing spherical coordinates     The videos used in this section (and later) were recorded for an earlier version of the textbook, that used the polar angle instead of the elevation angle. Some of the details will therefore differ from those presented in the text. (The reader can consider this an opportunity to learn and compare both conventions.)   The following Key Idea gives conversions to\/from our three spatial coordinate systems.   Converting Between Rectangular, Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates     Rectangular and Cylindrical       Rectangular and Spherical       Cylindrical and Spherical           Converting between rectangular and spherical coordinates   Convert the rectangular point to spherical coordinates, and convert the spherical point to rectangular and cylindrical coordinates.    This rectangular point is the same as used in Example . Using Key Idea , we find . Using the same logic as in Example , we find . Finally, , giving , or about . Thus the spherical coordinates are approximately .  Converting the spherical point to rectangular, we have , and . Thus the rectangular coordinates are .  To convert this spherical point to cylindrical, we have , and , giving the cylindrical point .     Canonical surfaces in spherical coordinates   Describe the surfaces , and , given in spherical coordinates.    The equation describes all points in space that are 1 unit away from the origin: this is the sphere of radius 1, centered at the origin.  The equation describes the same surface in spherical coordinates as it does in cylindrical coordinates: beginning with the line in the -plane as given by polar coordinates, extend the line parallel to the -axis, forming a plane.  The equation describes all points in space where the ray from the origin to makes an angle of with the -plane. This describes a cone, with the positive -axis its axis of symmetry, with point at the origin.   Graphing the canonical surfaces in spherical coordinates from Example       All three surfaces are graphed in Figure . Note how their intersection uniquely defines the point .    Spherical coordinates are useful when describing certain domains in space, allowing us to evaluate triple integrals over these domains more easily than if we used rectangular coordinates or cylindrical coordinates. The crux of setting up a triple integral in spherical coordinates is appropriately describing the small amount of volume,  , used in the integral.  Considering Figure , we can make a small spherical wedge by varying , and each a small amount, , and , respectively. This wedge is approximately a rectangular solid when the change in each coordinate is small, giving a volume of about .   Approximating the volume of a standard region in space using spherical coordinates       Given a region in space, we can approximate the volume of with many such wedges. As the size of each of , and goes to zero, the number of wedges increases to infinity and the volume of is more accurately approximated, giving .  Again, this development of should sound reasonable, and the following theorem states it is the appropriate manner by which triple integrals are to be evaluated in spherical coordinates.   It is generally most intuitive to evaluate the triple integral in Theorem by integrating with respect to first; it often does not matter whether we next integrate with respect to or . Different texts present different standard orders, some preferring instead of . As the bounds for these variables are usually constants in practice, it generally is a matter of preference.    Triple Integration in Spherical Coordinates   Let be a continuous function on a closed, bounded region in space, bounded in spherical coordinates by , and . Then integration with spherical coordinates  .     Establishing the volume of a sphere   Let be the region in space bounded by the sphere, centered at the origin, of radius . Use a triple integral in spherical coordinates to find the volume of .    The sphere of radius , centered at the origin, has equation . To obtain the full sphere, the bounds on and are and . This leads us to: , the familiar formula for the volume of a sphere. Note how the integration steps were easy, not using square roots nor integration steps such as Substitution.     Setting up an integral in spherical coorindates     Finding the center of mass using spherical coordinates   Find the center of mass of the solid with constant density enclosed above by and below by , as illustrated in Figure .   Graphing the solid, and its center of mass, from Example         We will set up the four triple integrals needed to find the center of mass ( , to compute , , and ) and leave it to the reader to evaluate each integral. Because of symmetry, we expect the - and - coordinates of the center of mass to be 0.  While the surfaces describing the solid are given in the statement of the problem, to describe the full solid , we use the following bounds: , and . Since density is constant, we assume .  The mass of the solid: .  To compute , the integrand is ; using Key Idea , we have . This gives: , which we expected as we expect .  To compute , the integrand is ; using Key Idea , we have . This gives: , which we also expected as we expect .  To compute , the integrand is ; using Key Idea , we have . This gives: .  Thus the center of mass is , as indicated in Figure .     Two more spherical coordinate examples    This section has provided a brief introduction into two new coordinate systems useful for identifying points in space. Each can be used to define a variety of surfaces in space beyond the canonical surfaces graphed as each system was introduced.  However, the usefulness of these coordinate systems does not lie in the variety of surfaces that they can describe nor the regions in space these surfaces may enclose. Rather, cylindrical coordinates are mostly used to describe cylinders and spherical coordinates are mostly used to describe spheres. These shapes are of special interest in the sciences, especially in physics, and computations on\/inside these shapes is difficult using rectangular coordinates. For instance, in the study of electricity and magnetism, one often studies the effects of an electrical current passing through a wire; that wire is essentially a cylinder, described well by cylindrical coordinates.  This chapter investigated the natural follow-on to partial derivatives: iterated integration. We learned how to use the bounds of a double integral to describe a region in the plane using both rectangular and polar coordinates, then later expanded to use the bounds of a triple integral to describe a region in space. We used double integrals to find volumes under surfaces, surface area, and the center of mass of lamina; we used triple integrals as an alternate method of finding volumes of space regions and also to find the center of mass of a region in space.  Integration does not stop here. We could continue to iterate our integrals, next investigating quadruple integrals whose bounds describe a region in 4-dimensional space (which are very hard to visualize). We can also look back to regular integration where we found the area under a curve in the plane. A natural analogue to this is finding the area under a curve, where the curve is in space, not in a plane. These are just two of many avenues to explore under the heading of integration.      Terms and Concepts   Explain the difference between the roles , in cylindrical coordinates, and , in spherical coordinates, play in determining the location of a point.   In cylindrical, determines how far from the origin one goes in the -plane before considering the -component. Equivalently, if on projects a point in cylindrical coordinates onto the -plane, will be the distance of this projection from the origin.  In spherical, is the distance from the origin to the point.    Why are points on the -axis not determined uniquely when using cylindrical and spherical coordinates?   If or , then the point in each coordinate system lies on the -axis regardless of the value of .    What surfaces are naturally defined using cylindrical coordinates?   Cylinders (tubes) centered at the origin, parallel to the -axis; planes parallel to the -axis that intersect the -axis; planes parallel to the -plane.    What surfaces are naturally defined using spherical coordinates?   Spheres centered at the origin; planes parallel to the -axis that intersect the -axis; cones centered on the -axis with point at the origin.     Problems    In the following exercises, points are given in either the rectangular, cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems. Find the coordinates of the points in the other systems.

This is upper half of the sphere of radius 3 centered at the origin ( , the upper hemisphere).

  "body": " Introduction to Line Integrals   We first used integration to find area under a curve. In this section, we learn to do this (again), but in a different context.    Line Integrals of Functions   Introducing the line integral    Consider the surface and curve shown in Figure . The surface is given by . The dashed curve lies in the -plane and is the familiar parabola from ; we'll call this curve . The curve drawn with a solid line in the graph is the curve in space that lies on our surface with and values that lie on .  The question we want to answer is this: what is the area that lies below the curve drawn with the solid line? In other words, what is the area of the region above and under the the surface ? This region is shown in Figure .  We suspect the answer can be found using an integral, but before trying to figure out what that integral is, let us first try to approximate its value.   Finding area under a curve in space                          In Figure , four rectangles have been drawn over the curve . The bottom corners of each rectangle lie on , and each rectangle has a height given by the function for some pair along between the rectangle's bottom corners.  As we know how to find the area of each rectangle, we are able to approximate the area above and under . Clearly, our approximation will be an approximation . The heights of the rectangles do not match exactly with the surface , nor does the base of each rectangle follow perfectly the path of .  In typical calculus fashion, our approximation can be improved by using more rectangles. The sum of the areas of these rectangles gives an approximate value of the true area above and under . As the area of each rectangle is height width , we assert that the .  When first learning of the integral, and approximating areas with heights widths , the width was a small change in : . That will not suffice in this context. Rather, each width of a rectangle is actually approximating the arc length of a small portion of . In Section , we used to represent the arc-length parameter of a curve. A small amount of arc length will thus be represented by .  The height of each rectangle will be determined in some way by the surface . If we parametrize by , an -value corresponds to an pair that lies on the parabola . Since is a function of and , and and are functions of , we can say that is a function of . Given a value , we can compute and find a height. Thus .  Here we have introduce a new notation, the integral symbol with a subscript of . It is reminiscent of our usage of . Using the train of thought found in the Integration Review preceding this section, we interpret as meaning sum up, along a curve , function values small arc lengths. It is understood here that represents the arc-length parameter.  All this leads us to a definition. The integral found in Equation is called a line integral . We formally define it below, but note that the definition is very abstract. On one hand, one is apt to say the definition makes sense, while on the other, one is equally apt to say but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this definition. We'll address that after the definition, and actually find an answer to the area problem we posed at the beginning of this section.   Line Integral Over A Scalar Field   Let be a smooth curve parametrized by , the arc-length parameter, and let be a continuous function of . A line integral is an integral of the form , where is any partition of the -interval over which is defined, is any value in the th subinterval, is the width of the th subinterval, and is the length of the longest subinterval in the partition. line integral over scalar field       Note:  Definition uses the term scalar field which has not yet been defined. Its meaning is discussed in the paragraph preceding Definition when it is compared to a vector field .   When is a closed curve, , a curve that ends at the same point at which it starts, we use .  The definition of the line integral does not specify whether is a curve in the plane or space (or hyperspace), as the definition holds regardless. For now, we'll assume lies in the -plane.  This definition of the line integral doesn't really say anything new. If is a curve and is the arc-length parameter of on , then .  The real difference with this integral from the standard we used in the past is that of context. Our previous integrals naturally summed up values over an interval on the -axis, whereas now we are summing up values over a curve. If we can parametrize the curve with the arc-length parameter, we can evaluate the line integral just as before. Unfortunately, parametrizing a curve in terms of the arc-length parameter is usually very difficult, so we must develop a method of evaluating line integrals using a different parametrization.  Given a curve , find any parametrization of : and , for continuous functions and , where . We can represent this parametrization with a vector-valued function, .  In Section , we defined the arc-length parameter in Equation as .  By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, . We can substitute the right hand side of this equation for in the line integral definition.  We can view as being a function of and since it is a function of . Thus . This gives us a concrete way to evaluate a line integral: .  We restate this as a theorem, along with its three-dimensional analogue, followed by an example where we finally evaluate an integral and find an area.   Evaluating a Line Integral Over A Scalar Field      Let be a curve parametrized by , , where and are continuously differentiable, and let , where is continuous over . Then line integral over scalar field  .    Let be a curve parametrized by , , where , and are continuously differentiable, and let , where is continuous over . Then .       To be clear, the first point of Theorem can be used to find the area under a surface and above a curve . We will later give an understanding of the line integral when is a curve in space.  Let's do an example where we actually compute an area.   Evaluating a line integral: area under a surface over a curve   Find the area under the surface over the curve , which is the segment of the line on , as shown in Figure .   Finding area under a curve in Example                     Our first step is to represent with a vector-valued function. Since is a simple line, and we have a explicit relationship between and (namely, that is ), we can let , , and write for .  We find the values of over as . We also need ; with , we have . Thus .  The area we seek is .    We will practice setting up and evaluating a line integral in another example, then find the area described at the beginning of this section.   Evaluating a line integral: area under a surface over a curve   Find the area over the unit circle in the -plane and under the surface , shown in Figure .   Finding area under a curve in Example                     The curve is the unit circle, which we will describe with the parametrization for . We find , so .  We find the values of over as . Thus the area we seek is (note the use of the notation): .  (Note: we may have approximated this answer from the start. The unit circle has a circumference of , and we may have guessed that due to the apparent symmetry of our surface, the average height of the surface is 3.)    We now consider the example that introduced this section.   Evaluating a line integral: area under a surface over a curve   Find the area under and over the parabola , from .    We parametrize our curve as for ; we find , so .  Replacing and with their respective functions of , we have . Thus the area under and over is found to be .    We give one more example of finding area.   Evaluating a line integral: area under a curve in space   Find the area above the -plane and below the helix parametrized by , for , as shown in Figure .   Finding area under a curve in Example         Note how this is problem is different than the previous examples: here, the height is not given by a surface, but by the curve itself.  We use the given vector-valued function to determine the curve in the -plane by simply using the first two components of \\vec r(t): . Thus .  The height is not found by evaluating a surface over , but rather it is given directly by the third component of \\vec r(t): . Thus , where the approximation was obtained using numerical methods.     Another line integral example    Note how in each of the previous examples we are effectively finding area under a curve , just as we did when first learning of integration. We have used the phrase area over a curve and under a surface, but that is because of the important role plays in the integral. The figures show how the curve defines another curve on the surface , and we are finding the area under that curve.    Properties of Line Integrals  Many properties of line integrals can be inferred from general integration properties. For instance, if is a scalar, then .  One property in particular of line integrals is worth noting. If is a curve composed of subcurves and , where they share only one point in common (see Figure , then the line integral over is the sum of the line integrals over and : .   Illustrating properties of line integrals                   This property allows us to evaluate line integrals over some curves that are not smooth. Note how in Figure the curve is not smooth at , so by our definition of the line integral we cannot evaluate . However, one can evaluate line integrals over and and their sum will be the desired quantity.  A curve that is composed of two or more smooth curves is said to be piecewise smooth . In this chapter, any statement that is made about smooth curves also holds for piecewise smooth curves. smooth curve piecewise  piecewise smooth curve   We state these properties as a theorem.   Properties of Line Integrals Over Scalar Fields      Let be a smooth curve parametrized by the arc-length parameter , let and be continuous functions of , and let and be scalars. Then line integral properties over a scalar field  .    Let be piecewise smooth, composed of smooth components and . Then .         Mass and Center of Mass  We first learned integration as a method to find area under a curve, then later used integration to compute a variety of other quantities, such as arc length, volume, force, etc. In this section, we also introduced line integrals as a method to find area under a curve, and now we explore one more application.  Let a curve (either in the plane or in space) represent a thin wire with variable density . We can approximate the mass of the wire by dividing the wire ( , the curve) into small segments of length and assume the density is constant across these small segments. The mass of each segment is density of the segment its length; by summing up the approximate mass of each segment we can approximate the total mass: .  By taking the limit as the length of the segments approaches 0, we have the definition of the line integral as seen in Definition . When learning of the line integral, we let represent a height; now we let represent a density.  We can extend this understanding of computing mass to also compute the center of mass of a thin wire. (As a reminder, the center of mass can be a useful piece of information as objects rotate about that center.) We give the relevant formulas in the next definition, followed by an example. Note the similarities between this definition and Definition , which gives similar properties of solids in space.   Mass, Center of Mass of Thin Wire   Let a thin wire lie along a smooth curve with continuous density function , where is the arc length parameter. mass center of  mass    The mass of the thin wire is .    The moment about the -plane is .    The moment about the -plane is .    The moment about the -plane is .    The center of mass of the wire is .        Evaluating a line integral: calculating mass   A thin wire follows the path , . The density of the wire is determined by its position in space: gm\/cm. The wire is shown in Figure , where a light color indicates low density and a dark color represents high density. Find the mass and center of mass of the wire.   Finding the mass of a thin wire in Example         We compute the density of the wire as .  We compute as .  Thus the mass is .  We compute the moments about the coordinate planes:   Thus the center of mass of the wire is located at , as indicated by the dot in Figure . Note how in this example, the curve is centered about the point , though the variable density of the wire pulls the center of mass out along the and axes.    We end this section with a callback to the Integration Review that preceded this section. A line integral looks like: . As stated before the definition of the line integral, this means sum up, along a curve , function values  small arc lengths. When represents a height, we have height length = area. When is a density (and we use by convention), we have density (mass per unit length) length = mass.   In the next section, we investigate a new mathematical object, the vector field . The remaining sections of this chapter are devoted to understanding integration in the context of vector fields.     Terms and Concepts   Explain how a line integral can be used to find the area under a curve.   When is a curve in the plane and is a surface defined over , then describes the area under the spatial curve that lies on , over .    How does the evaluation of a line integral given as differ from a line integral given as ?   The evaluation is the same. The notation signifies that the curve is a closed curve, though the evaluation is the same.    Why are most line integrals evaluated using Key Idea instead of directly as ?   The variable denotes the arc-length parameter, which is generally difficult to use. The Key Idea allows one to parametrize a curve using another, ideally easier-to-use, parameter.

  "body": " Vector Fields   We have studied functions of two and three variables, where the input of such functions is a point (either a point in the plane or in space) and the output is a number.  We could also create functions where the input is a point (again, either in the plane or in space), but the output is a vector . For instance, we could create the following function: , where . We are to think of assigning the vector to the point ; in some sense, the vector lies at the point .   Introducing vector fields    Such functions are extremely useful in any context where magnitude and direction are important. For instance, we could create a function that represents the electromagnetic force exerted at a point by a electromagnetic field, or the velocity of air as it moves across an airfoil.  Because these functions are so important, we need to formally define them.   Vector Field      A vector field in the plane is a function whose domain is a subset of and whose output is a two-dimensional vector: vector field  .    A vector field in space is a function whose domain is a subset of and whose output is a three-dimensional vector: .       This definition may seem odd at first, as a special type of function is called a field. However, as the function determines a field of vectors , we can say the field is defined by the function, and thus the field is a function.   Demonstrating methods of graphing vector fields                   Visualizing vector fields helps cement this connection. When graphing a vector field in the plane, the general idea is to draw the vector at the point . For instance, using as before, at we would draw .  In Figure , one can see that the vector is drawn starting from the point . A total of 8 vectors are drawn, with the - and -values of . In many ways, the resulting graph is a mess; it is hard to tell what this field looks like.   In Figure , the same field is redrawn with each vector drawn centered on the point . This makes for a better looking image, though the long vectors can cause confusion: when one vector intersects another, the image looks cluttered.  A common way to address this problem is limit the length of each arrow, and represent long vectors with thick arrows, as done in Figure . Usually we do not use a graph of a vector field to determine exactly the magnitude of a particular vector. Rather, we are more concerned with the relative magnitudes of vectors: which are bigger than others? Thus limiting the length of the vectors is not problematic.   Demonstrating methods of graphing vector fields                   Drawing arrows with variable thickness is best done with technology; search the documentation of your favorite graphing program for terms like vector fields or slope fields to learn how. Technology obviously allows us to plot many vectors in a vector field nicely; in Figure , we see the same vector field drawn with many vectors, and finally get a clear picture of how this vector field behaves. (If this vector field represented the velocity of air moving across a flat surface, we could see that the air tends to move either to the upper-right or lower-left, and moves very slowly near the origin.)  We can similarly plot vector fields in space, as shown in Figure , though it is not often done. The plots get very busy very quickly, as there are lots of arrows drawn in a small amount of space. In Figure the field is graphed. If one could view the graph from above, one could see the arrows point in a circle about the -axis. One should also note how the arrows far from the origin are larger than those close to the origin.  It is good practice to try to visualize certain vector fields in one's head. For instance, consider a point mass at the origin and the vector field that represents the gravitational force exerted by the mass at any point in the room. The field would consist of arrows pointing toward the origin, increasing in size as they near the origin (as the gravitational pull is strongest near the point mass).   Graphing a vector field in space         Vector Field Notation and Del Operator   Definition defines a vector field using the notation .  That is, the components of are each functions of and (and also in space). As done in other contexts, we will drop the of , and portions of the notation and refer to vector fields in the plane and in space as , respectively, as this shorthand is quite convenient.  Another item of notation will become useful: the del operator.  del operator Recall in Section how we used the symbol (pronounced del ) to represent the gradient of a function of two variables. That is, if , then del   .   Introducing the del operator    We now define to be the del operator. It is a vector whose components are partial derivative operations.  In the plane, ; in space, .  With this definition of , we can better understand the gradient . As returns a scalar, the properties of scalar and vector multiplication gives .   Del and the gradient    Now apply the del operator to vector fields. Let . We can use vector operations and find the dot product of and : .  We can also compute their cross products: .  We do not yet know why we would want to compute the above. However, as we next learn about properties of vector fields, we will see how these dot and cross products with the del operator are quite useful.    Divergence and Curl  Two properties of vector fields will prove themselves to be very important: divergence and curl. Each is a special derivative of a vector field; that is, each measures an instantaneous rate of change of a vector field.   Introducing the divergence    If the vector field represents the velocity of a fluid or gas, then the divergence  divergence  vector field divergence of of the field is a measure of the compressibility of the fluid. If the divergence is negative at a point, it means that the fluid is compressing: more fluid is going into the point than is going out. If the divergence is positive, it means the fluid is expanding: more fluid is going out at that point than going in. A divergence of zero means the same amount of fluid is going in as is going out. If the divergence is zero at all points, we say the field is incompressible . incompressible vector field   It turns out that the proper measure of divergence is simply , as stated in the following definition.   Divergence of a Vector Field   The divergence of a vector field is divergence  vector field divergence of  .   In the plane, with , .    In space, with , .        Introducing the curl     Curl vector field curl of  curl is a measure of the spinning action of the field. Let represent the flow of water over a flat surface. If a small round cork were held in place at a point in the water, would the water cause the cork to spin? No spin corresponds to zero curl; counterclockwise spin corresponds to positive curl and clockwise spin corresponds to negative curl.  In space, things are a bit more complicated. Again let represent the flow of water, and imagine suspending a tennis ball in one location in this flow. The water may cause the ball to spin along an axis. If so, the curl of the vector field is a vector (not a scalar , as before), parallel to the axis of rotation, following a right hand rule: when the thumb of one's right hand points in the direction of the curl, the ball will spin in the direction of the curling fingers of the hand.  In space, it turns out the proper measure of curl is , as stated in the following definition. To find the curl of a planar vector field , embed it into space as and apply the cross product definition. Since and are functions of just and (and not ), all partial derivatives with respect to become 0 and the result is simply . The third component is the measure of curl of a planar vector field.   Curl of a Vector Field      Let be a vector field in the plane. The curl of is . curl     Let be a vector field in space. The curl of is .       We adopt the convention of referring to curl as , regardless of whether is a vector field in two or three dimensions.   Interpreting the curl of a vector field    We now practice computing these quantities.   Computing divergence and curl of planar vector fields   For each of the planar vector fields given below, view its graph and try to visually determine if its divergence and curl are 0. Then compute the divergence and curl.    (see Figure )     (see Figure )     (see Figure )     (see Figure )          The arrow sizes are constant along any horizontal line, so if one were to draw a small box anywhere on the graph, it would seem that the same amount of fluid would enter the box as exit. Therefore it seems the divergence is zero; it is, as .   The vector fields in parts 1 and 2 in Example                   At any point on the -axis, arrows above it move to the right and arrows below it move to the left, indicating that a cork placed on the axis would spin clockwise. A cork placed anywhere above the -axis would have water above it moving to the right faster than the water below it, also creating a clockwise spin. A clockwise spin also appears to be created at points below the -axis. Thus it seems the curl should be negative (and not zero). Indeed, it is: .    It appears that all vectors that lie on a circle of radius , centered at the origin, have the same length (and indeed this is true). That implies that the divergence should be zero: draw any box on the graph, and any fluid coming in will lie along a circle that takes the same amount of fluid out. Indeed, the divergence is zero, as . Clearly this field moves objects in a circle, but would it induce a cork to spin? It appears that yes, it would: place a cork anywhere in the flow, and the point of the cork closest to the origin would feel less flow than the point on the cork farthest from the origin, which would induce a counterclockwise flow. Indeed, the curl is positive: . Since the curl is constant, we conclude the induced spin is the same no matter where one is in this field.    At the origin, there are many arrows pointing out but no arrows pointing in. We conclude that at the origin, the divergence must be positive (and not zero). If one were to draw a box anywhere in the field, the edges farther from the origin would have larger arrows passing through them than the edges close to the origin, indicating that more is going from a point than going in. This indicates a positive (and not zero) divergence. This is correct: . One may find this curl to be harder to determine visually than previous examples. One might note that any arrow that induces a clockwise spin on a cork will have an equally sized arrow inducing a counterclockwise spin on the other side, indicating no spin and no curl. This is correct, as .   The vector fields in parts 3 and 4 in Example                     One might find this divergence hard to determine visually as large arrows appear in close proximity to small arrows, each pointing in different directions. Instead of trying to rationalize a guess, we compute the divergence: . Perhaps surprisingly, the divergence is 0. Will all the loops of different directions in the field, one is apt to reason the curl is variable. Indeed, it is: . Depending on the values of and , the curl may be positive, negative, or zero.        Computing divergence and curl of vector fields in space   Compute the divergence and curl of each of the following vector fields.                We compute the divergence and curl of each field following the definitions.    . For this particular field, no matter the location in space, a spin is induced with axis parallel to .             Further examples with divergence     Creating a field representing gravitational force   The force of gravity between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. Locate a point mass at the origin. Create a vector field that represents the gravitational pull of the point mass at any point . Find the divergence and curl of this field.    The point mass pulls toward the origin, so at , the force will pull in the direction of . To get the proper magnitude, it will be useful to find the unit vector in this direction. Dividing by its magnitude, we have .  The magnitude of the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two points. Letting be the constant of proportionality, we have the magnitude as . Multiplying this magnitude by the unit vector above, we have the desired vector field: .  We leave it to the reader to confirm that and .  The analogous planar vector field is given in Figure . Note how all arrows point to the origin, and the magnitude gets very small when far from the origin.     A vector field representing a planar gravitational force       A function naturally induces a vector field, . Given what we learned of the gradient in Section , we know that the vectors of point in the direction of greatest increase of . Because of this, is said to be the potential function  potential function  vector field potential function of of . Vector fields that are the gradient of potential functions will play an important role in the next section.   A vector field that is the gradient of a potential function   Let and let . Graph , and find the divergence and curl of .    Given , we find . A graph of is given in Figure . In Figure , the vector field is given along with a graph of the surface itself; one can see how each vector is pointing in the direction of steepest uphill , which, in this case, is not simply just toward the origin.    A graph of a function and the vector field in Example                   We leave it to the reader to confirm that and .    There are some important concepts visited in this section that will be revisited in subsequent sections and again at the very end of this chapter. One is: given a vector field , both and are measures of rates of change of . The divergence measures how much the field spreads (diverges) at a point, and the curl measures how much the field twists (curls) at a point. Another important concept is this: given , the gradient is also a measure of a rate of change of . We will see how the integrals of these rates of change produce meaningful results.  This section introduces the concept of a vector field. The next section applies calculus to vector fields. A common application is this: let be a vector field representing a force (hence it is called a force field, though this name has a decidedly comic-book feel) and let a particle move along a curve under the influence of this force. What work is performed by the field on this particle? The solution lies in correctly applying the concepts of line integrals in the context of vector fields.     Terms and Concepts   Give two quantities that can be represented by a vector field in the plane or in space.   Answers will vary. Appropriate answers include velocities of moving particles (air, water, etc.); gravitational or electromagnetic forces.    In your own words, describe what it means for a vector field to have a negative divergence at a point.   Specific answers will vary, though should relate to the idea that more of the vector field is moving into that point than out of that point.     In your own words, describe what it means for a vector field to have a negative curl at a point.   Specific answers will vary, though should relate to the idea that the vector field is spinning clockwise at that point.    The divergence of a vector field at a particular point is 0. Does this mean that is incompressible? Why\/why not?   No; to be incompressible, the divergence needs to be 0 everywhere, not just at one point.

  "title": "Line Integrals over Vector Fields",
  "body": " Line Integrals over Vector Fields   Suppose a particle moves along a curve under the influence of an electromagnetic force described by a vector field . Since a force is inducing motion, work is performed. How can we calculate how much work is performed?  Recall that when moving in a straight line, if represents a constant force and represents the direction and length of travel, then work is simply . However, we generally want to be able to calculate work even if is not constant and is not a straight line.  As we have practiced many times before, we can calculate work by first approximating, then refining our approximation through a limit that leads to integration.   Line integrals of scalar fields, revisited    Assume as we did in Section that can be parametrized by the arc length parameter . Over a short piece of the curve with length , the curve is approximately straight and our force is approximately constant. The straight-line direction of this short length of curve is given by , the unit tangent vector; let , which gives the direction and magnitude of a small section of . Thus work over this small section of is .  Summing up all the work over these small segments gives an approximation of the work performed. By taking the limit as goes to zero, and hence the number of segments approaches infinity, we can obtain the exact amount of work. Following the logic presented at the beginning of this chapter in the Integration Review, we see that , a line integral.  This line integral is beautiful in its simplicity, yet is not so useful in making actual computations (largely because the arc length parameter is so difficult to work with). To compute actual work, we need to parametrize with another parameter via a vector-valued function . As stated in Section , , and recall that . Thus , where the final integral uses the differential for .    Evaluating Line Integrals over Vector Fields  These integrals are known as line integrals over vector fields . By contrast, the line integrals we dealt with in Section are sometimes referred to as line integrals over scalar fields . line integral over scalar field Just as a vector field is defined by a function that returns a vector, a scalar field is a function that returns a scalar, such as . We waited until now to introduce this terminology so we could contrast the concept with vector fields.  We formally define this line integral, then give examples and applications.   Line Integral Over A Vector Field   Let be a vector field with continuous components defined on a smooth curve , parametrized by , and let be the unit tangent vector of . The line integral over along is line integral over vector field  .    In Definition , note how the dot product is just a scalar. Therefore, this new line integral is really just a special kind of line integral found in Section ; letting , the right-hand side simply becomes , and we can use the techniques of that section to evaluate the integral. We combine those techniques, along with parts of Equation , to clearly state how to evaluate a line integral over a vector field in the following Key Idea.   Introducing line integrals of vector fields     Evaluating a Line Integral Over A Vector Field  Let be a vector field with continuous components defined on a smooth curve , parametrized by , , where is continuously differentiable. Then vector field over vector field  .   An important concept implicit in this Key Idea: we can use any continuously differentiable parametrization of that preserves the orientation of : there isn't a right one. In practice, choose one that seems easy to work with.   Notation note: the above Definition and Key Idea implicitly evaluate along the curve , which is parametrized by . For instance, if and , then evaluating along means substituting the - and -components of in for and , respectively, in . Therefore, along , . Since we are substituting the output of for the input of , we write this as . This is a slight abuse of notation as technically the input of is to be a point , not a vector , but this shorthand is useful.  We use an example to practice evaluating line integrals over vector fields.   Evaluating a line integral over a vector field: computing work   Two particles move from to under the influence of the force field . One particle follows , the line ; the other follows , the curve , as shown in Figure . Force is measured in newtons and distance is measured in meters. Find the work performed by each particle.   Paths through a vector field in Example         To compute work, we need to parametrize each path. We use to parametrize , and let parametrize ; for each, .  Along the straight-line path, . We find . The integral that computes work is: .  Along the curve , . We find . The work performed along this path is .  Note how differing amounts of work are performed along the different paths. This should not be too surprising: the force is variable, one path is longer than the other, etc.     Evaluating a line integral over a vector field: computing work   Two particles move from to under the influence of a force field . One moves along the curve , the parabola defined by . The other particle moves along the curve , the bottom half of the circle defined by , as shown in Figure . Force is measured in pounds and distances are measured in feet. Find the work performed by moving each particle along its path.   Paths through a vector field in Example         We start by parametrizing : the parametrization is straightforward, giving . On , .  Computing the work along , we have: .  For , it is probably simplest to parametrize the half circle using sine and cosine. Recall that is a parametrization of the unit circle on ; we add 1 to the second component to shift the circle up one unit, then restrict the domain to to obtain only the lower half, giving , , and hence and .  Computing the work along , we have: .  Note how the work along and in this example is the same. We'll address why later in this section when conservative fields and path independence are discussed.      Properties of Line Integrals Over Vector Fields  Line integrals over vector fields share the same properties as line integrals over scalar fields, with one important distinction. The orientation of the curve matters with line integrals over vector fields, whereas it did not matter with line integrals over scalar fields.   Reivew of terminology for curves    It is relatively easy to see why. Let be the unit circle. The area under a surface over is the same whether we traverse the circle in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion, hence the line integral over a scalar field on is the same irrespective of orientation. On the other hand, if we are computing work done by a force field, direction of travel definitely matters. Opposite directions create opposite signs when computing dot products, so traversing the circle in opposite directions will create line integrals that differ by a factor of .   Properties of Line Integrals Over Vector Fields      Let and be vector fields with continuous components defined on a smooth curve , parametrized by , and let and be scalars. Then line integral properties over a vector field  .    Let be piecewise smooth, composed of smooth components and . Then .    Let be the curve with opposite orientation, parametrized by . Then .        Properties of line integrals    We demonstrate using these properties in the following example.   Using properties of line integrals over vector fields   Let and let be the path that starts at , goes to along the curve , then returns to along the line , as shown in Figure . Evaluate .   The vector field and curve in Example         As is piecewise smooth, we break it into two components and , where follows the curve and follows the curve .  We parametrize with on , with . We will use .  While we always have unlimited ways in which to parametrize a curve, there are 2 direct methods to choose from when parametrizing . The parametrization , traces the correct line segment but with the wrong orientation. Using Property 3 of Theorem , we can use this parametrization and negate the result.  Another choice is to use the techniques of Section to create the line with the orientation we desire. We wish to start at and travel in the direction for one length of , giving equation on .  Either choice is fine; we choose to practice using line integral properties. We find and .  Evaluating the line integral (note how we subtract the integral over as the orientation of is opposite): .  If we interpret this integral as computing work, the negative work implies that the motion is mostly against the direction of the force, which seems plausible when we look at Figure .     Computing a line integral over a piecewise smooth curve     Evaluating a line integral over a vector field in space   Let , and let be the portion of the helix given by on , as shown in Figure . Evaluate .   The graph of in Example         A parametrization is already given for , so we just need to find and \\vec r '(t).  We have and . Thus .     Evaluating a line integral presented in differential form      The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals  We are preparing to make important statements about the value of certain line integrals over special vector fields. Before we can do that, we need to define some terms that describe the domains over which a vector field is defined. line integral Fundamental Theorem  Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals    Introducing the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals    A region in the plane is connected  connected if any two points in the region can be joined by a piecewise smooth curve that lies entirely in the region. In Figure , sets and are connected; set is not connected, though it is composed of two connected subregions.  A region is simply connected  simply connected  connected simply if every simple closed curve that lies entirely in the region can be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a single point without leaving the region. (A curve is simple  simple curve if it does not cross itself.) In Figure , only set is simply connected. Region is not simply connected as any closed curve that goes around the hole in cannot be continuously shrunk to a single point. As is not even connected, it cannot be simply connected, though again it consists of two simply connected subregions.  We have applied these terms to regions of the plane, but they can be extended intuitively to domains in space (and hyperspace). In Figure , the domain bounded by the sphere (at left) and the domain with a subsphere removed (at right) are both simply connected. Any simple closed path that lies entirely within these domains can be continuously deformed into a single point. In Figure , neither domain is simply connected. A left, the ball has a hole that extends its length and the pictured closed path cannot be deformed to a point. At right, two paths are illustrated on the torus that cannot be shrunk to a point.  We will use the terms connected and simply connected in subsequent definitions and theorems.   is simply connected; is connected, but not simply connected; is not connected        The domains in (a) are simply connected, while the domains in (b) are not                   Recall how in Example particles moved from to along two different paths, wherein the same amount of work was performed along each path. It turns out that regardless of the choice of path from to , the amount of work performed under the field is the same. Since our expectation is that differing amounts of work are performed along different paths, we give such special fields a name.   Conservative Field, Path Independent   Let be a vector field defined on an open, connected domain in the plane or in space containing points and . If the line integral has the same value for all choices of paths starting at and ending at , then conservative field  vector field conservative  path independent  line integral path independent     is a conservative field and    The line integral is path independent and can be written as .       When is a conservative field, the line integral from points to is sometimes written as to emphasize the independence of its value from the choice of path; all that matters are the beginning and ending points of the path.  How can we tell if a field is conservative? To show a field is conservative using the definition, we need to show that all line integrals from points to have the same value. It is equivalent to show that all line integrals over closed paths are 0. Each of these tasks are generally nontrivial.  There is a simpler method. Consider the surface defined by . We can compute the gradient of this function: . Note that this is the field from Example , which we have claimed is conservative. We will soon give a theorem that states that a field is conservative if, and only if, it is the gradient of some scalar function . To show is conservative, we need to determine whether or not for some function . (We'll later see that there is a yet simpler method). To recognize the special relationship between and in this situation, is given a name.   Potential Function   Let be a differentiable function defined on a domain in the plane or in space ( , or ) and let , the gradient of . Then is a potential function of . potential function  vector field potential function of     We now state the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, which connects conservative fields and path independence to fields with potential functions.   Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals   Let be a vector field whose components are continuous on a connected domain in the plane or in space, let and be any points in , and let be any path in starting at and ending at . line integral Fundamental Theorem  Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals  conservative field  vector field conservative  path independent  line integral path independent     is conservative if and only if there exists a differentiable function such that .    If is conservative, then .       Once again considering Example , we have , and . In that example, we evaluated two line integrals from to and found the value of each was 2. Note that is a potential function for . Following the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, consider : , the same value given by the line integrals.  We practice using this theorem again in the next example.   Using the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals   Let , and . Use the first part of the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals to show that is conservative, then choose any path from to and confirm the second part of the theorem.    To show is conservative, we need to find such that . That is, we need to find such that and . As all we know about are its partial derivatives, we recover by integration: .  Note how the constant of integration is more than just a constant : it is anything that acts as a constant when taking a derivative with respect to . Any function that is a function of (containing no 's) acts as a constant when deriving with respect to .  Integrating in this example gives: .  Likewise, integrating with respect to gives: .  These two results should be equal with appropriate choices of and : .  We find , a potential function of . (If were not conservative, no choice of and would give equality.)  By the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, regardless of the path from to , .  To illustrate the validity of the Fundamental Theorem, we pick a path from to . The line between these two points would be simple to construct; we choose a slightly more complicated path by choosing the parabola . This leads to the parametrization , , with . Thus , which matches our previous result.     Further examples with the Fundamental Theorem (4 videos)    The Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals states that we can determine whether or not is conservative by determining whether or not has a potential function. This can be difficult. A simpler method exists if the domain of is simply connected (not just connected as needed in the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals), which is a reasonable requirement. We state this simpler method as a theorem.   Curl of Conservative Fields   Let be a vector field whose components are continuous on a simply connected domain in the plane or in space. Then is conservative if and only if or , respectively. curl of conservative fields  conservative field     In Example , we showed that is conservative by finding a potential function for . Using the above theorem, we can show that is conservative much more easily by computing its curl: .   Discussing conservative vector fields and path independence       Terms and Concepts   T\/F: In practice, the evaluation of line integrals over vector fields involves computing the magnitude of a vector-valued function.   False. It is true for line integrals over scalar fields, though.    Let be a vector field in the plane and let be a two-dimensional vector-valued function. Why is an abuse of notation ?   The input of should be a point in the plane, not a two dimensional vector.    T\/F: The orientation of a curve matters when computing a line integral over a vector field.   True.    T\/F: The orientation of a curve matters when computing a line integral over a scalar field.   False.    Under reasonable conditions, if , what can we conclude about the vector field ?   We can conclude that is conservative.    Let be a conservative field and let be a closed curve. Why are we able to conclude that ?   By the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, since is conservative, , where is a potential function for and and are the initial and terminal points of , respectively.

  "body": " Flow, Flux, Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem   Flow and Flux  Line integrals over vector fields have the natural interpretation of computing work when represents a force field. It is also common to use vector fields to represent velocities. In these cases, the line integral is said to represent flow . flow  flux  circulation    Illustrating the principles of flow and flux       Let the vector field represent the velocity of water as it moves across a smooth surface, depicted in Figure . A line integral over will compute how much water is moving along the path .   In the figure, all of the water above is moving along that curve, whereas none of the water above is moving along that curve (the curve and the flow of water are at right angles to each other). Because has nonzero horizontal and vertical components, some of the water above that curve is moving along the curve.  When is a closed curve, we call flow circulation , represented by .  The opposite of flow is flux , a measure of how much water is moving across the path . If a curve represents a filter in flowing water, flux measures how much water will pass through the filter. Considering again Figure , we see that a screen along will not filter any water as no water passes across that curve. Because of the nature of this field, and each filter the same amount of water per second.  The terms flow and flux are used apart from velocity fields, too. Flow is measured by , which is the same as by Definition . That is, flow is a summation of the amount of that is tangent to the curve .  By contrast, flux is a summation of the amount of that is orthogonal to the direction of travel. To capture this orthogonal amount of , we use to measure flux, where is a unit vector orthogonal to the curve . (Later, we'll measure flux across surfaces, too. For example, in physics it is useful to measure the amount of a magnetic field that passes through a surface.)   Further terminology for curves: closed, simple, positively oriented    How is determined? We'll later see that if is a closed curve, we'll want to point to the outside of the curve (measuring how much is going out ). We'll also adopt the convention that closed curves should be traversed counterclockwise.  (If is a complicated closed curve, it can be difficult to determine what counterclockwise means. Consider Figure . Seeing the curve as a whole, we know which way counterclockwise is. If we zoom in on point , one might incorrectly choose to traverse the path in the wrong direction. So we offer this definition: a closed curve is being traversed counterclockwise if the outside is to the right of the path and the inside is to the left. )   Determining counterclockwise is not always simple without a good definition       When a curve is traversed counterclockwise by , we rotate clockwise 90 to obtain : .  Letting , we calculate flux as: .  We summarize the above in the following definition.   Flow, Flux   Let be a vector field with continuous components defined on a smooth curve , parametrized by , let be the unit tangent vector of , and let be the clockwise 90 degree rotation of . flow  flux    The flow of along is .    The flux of across is .       This definition of flow also holds for curves in space, though it does not make sense to measure flux across a curve in space.  Measuring flow is essentially the same as finding work performed by a force as done in the previous examples. Therefore we practice finding only flux in the following example.   Finding flux across curves in the plane   Curves and each start at and end at , where follows the line and follows the unit circle, as shown in Figure . Find the flux across both curves for the vector fields and .   Illustrating the curves and vector fields in Example . In (a) the vector field is , and in (b) the vector field is .                     We begin by finding parametrizations of and . As done in Example , parametrize by creating the line that starts at and moves in the direction: , for . We parametrize with the familiar on . For reference later, we give each function and its derivative below: . .  When (as shown in Figure ), over we have and . Using Definition , we compute the flux: .  Over , we have and . Thus the flux across is: .  Notice how the flux was the same across both curves. This won't hold true when we change the vector field.  When (as shown in Figure ), over we have and . Computing the flux across : .  Over , we have and . Thus the flux across is: .  We analyze the results of this example below.    In Example , we saw that the flux across the two curves was the same when the vector field was . This is not a coincidence. We show why they are equal in Example . In short, the reason is this: the divergence of is 0, and when , the flux across any two paths with common beginning and ending points will be the same.  We also saw in the example that the flux across was 0 when the field was . Flux measures how much of the field crosses the path from left to right (following the conventions established before). Positive flux means most of the field is crossing from left to right; negative flux means most of the field is crossing from right to left; zero flux means the same amount crosses from each side. When we consider Figure , it seems plausible that the same amount of was crossing from left to right as from right to left.    Green's Theorem  There is an important connection between the circulation around a closed region and the curl of the vector field inside of , as well as a connection between the flux across the boundary of and the divergence of the field inside . These connections are described by Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem, respectively. We'll explore each in turn. Green's Theorem    Introducing Green's Theorem    Green's Theorem states the counterclockwise circulation around a closed region is equal to the sum of the curls over .    Green's Theorem   Let be a closed, bounded region of the plane whose boundary is composed of finitely many smooth curves, let be a counterclockwise parametrization of , and let where and are continuous over . Then Green's Theorem  .    We'll explore Green's Theorem through an example.   Confirming Green's Theorem   Let and let be the region of the plane bounded by the triangle with vertices , and , shown in Figure . Verify Green's Theorem; that is, find the circulation of around the boundary of and show that is equal to the double integral of over .   The vector field and planar region used in Example         The curve that bounds is composed of 3 lines. While we need to traverse the boundary of in a counterclockwise fashion, we may start anywhere we choose. We arbitrarily choose to start at , move to , etc., with each line parametrized by , and , respectively.  We leave it to the reader to confirm that the following parametrizations of the three lines are accurate:    ,  for ,  with ,    ,  for ,  with , and    ,  for ,  with .    The circulation around is found by summing the flow along each of the sides of the triangle. We again leave it to the reader to confirm the following computations: .  The circulation is the sum of the flows: .  We confirm Green's Theorem by computing . We find . The region is bounded by the lines , and . Integrating with the order is most straightforward, leading to , which matches our previous measurement of circulation.     Verifying Green's Theorem with an example     Using Green's Theorem   Let and let be the region enclosed by the curve parametrized by on , as shown in Figure . Find the circulation around .   The vector field and planar region used in Example         Computing the circulation directly using the line integral looks difficult, as the integrand will include terms like .   Green's Theorem states that ; since in this example, the double integral is simply 0 and hence the circulation is 0.  Since , we can conclude that the circulation is 0 in two ways. One method is to employ Green's Theorem as done above. The second way is to recognize that is a conservative field, hence there is a function wherein . Let be any point on the curve ; since is closed, we can say that  begins and ends at . By the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, .    Since Green's Theorem is an important result, it's worth taking a minute (or 12) to see why it's true, in the video in .   Sketching the proof of Green's Theorem    One can use Green's Theorem to find the area of an enclosed region by integrating along its boundary. Let be a closed curve, enclosing the region , parametrized by . We know the area of is computed by the double integral , where the integrand is . By creating a field where , we can employ Green's Theorem to compute the area of as .  One is free to choose any field to use as long as . Common choices are , and . We demonstrate this below.   Using Green's Theorem to find area   Let be the closed curve parametrized by on , enclosing the region , as shown in Figure . Find the area of .   The region , whose area is found in Example         We can choose any field , as long as . We choose . We also confirm (left to the reader) that traverses the region in a counterclockwise fashion. Thus .     Using Green's Theorem to find the area under a cycloid     Using Green's Theorem to derive a polygon area formula    Another interesting scenario that comes up is the case of multiply-connected regions (as opposed to simply-connected). If a bounded region has a hole , its boundary will consist of more than one curve: the outer boundary, as well as the boundary of the hole. Green's Theorem applies in this situation as well, as the video in explains.   Green's Theorem and multiply-connected regions      The Divergence Theorem  Green's Theorem makes a connection between the circulation around a closed region and the sum of the curls over . The Divergence Theorem makes a somewhat opposite connection: the total flux across the boundary of is equal to the sum of the divergences over .   The Divergence Theorem (in the plane)   Let be a closed, bounded region of the plane whose boundary is composed of finitely many smooth curves, let be a counterclockwise parametrization of , and let where and are continuous over . Then Divergence Theorem in the plane  .     Confirming the Divergence Theorem   Let , let be the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin and define to be the interior of that circle, as shown in Figure . Verify the Divergence Theorem; that is, find the flux across and show it is equal to the double integral of over .   The region used in Example         We parametrize the circle in the usual way, with    , . The flux across is .  We compute the divergence of as . Since the divergence is constant, we can compute the following double integral easily: , which matches our previous result.     Flux when   Let be any field where , and let and be any two nonintersecting paths, except that each begin at point and end at point (see Figure ). Show why the flux across and is the same.    By referencing Figure , we see we can make a closed path that combines with , where is traversed with its opposite orientation. We label the enclosed region . Since , the Divergence Theorem states that .  Using the properties and notation given in Theorem , consider:   As used in Example , the vector field has a divergence of 0 and the two paths only intersect at their initial and terminal points.        . Thus the flux across each path is equal.    In this section, we have investigated flow and flux, quantities that measure interactions between a vector field and a planar curve. We can also measure flow along spatial curves, though as mentioned before, it does not make sense to measure flux across spatial curves.  It does, however, make sense to measure the amount of a vector field that passes across a surface in space i.e, the flux across a surface. We will study this, though in the next section we first learn about a more powerful way to describe surfaces than using functions of the form .     Terms and Concepts   Let be a vector field and let be a curve. Flow is a measure of the amount of going  ; flux is a measure of the amount of going  .   along, across    What is circulation?   It is the measure of flow around the entirety of a closed curve .    Green's Theorem states, informally, that the circulation around a closed curve that bounds a region is equal to the sum of across .   the curl of , or     The Divergence Theorem states, informally, that the outward flux across a closed curve that bounds a region is equal to the sum of across .   the divergence of , or     Let be a vector field and let and be any nonintersecting paths except that each starts at point and ends at point .

  "title": "Parametrized Surfaces and Surface Area",
  "body": " Parametrized Surfaces and Surface Area   Thus far we have focused mostly on 2-dimensional vector fields, measuring flow and flux along\/across curves in the plane. Both Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem make connections between planar regions and their boundaries. We now move our attention to 3-dimensional vector fields, considering both curves and surfaces in space.    Parametrizing surfaces   Introducing parametrized surfaces    We are accustomed to describing surfaces as functions of two variables, usually written as . For our coming needs, this method of describing surfaces will prove to be insufficient. Instead, we will parametrize our surfaces, describing them as the set of terminal points of some vector-valued function . The bulk of this section is spent practicing the skill of describing a surface using a vector-valued function. Once this skill is developed, we'll show how to find the surface area of a parametrically-defined surface , a skill needed in the remaining sections of this chapter.   We use the letter to denote Surface Area. This section begins a study into surfaces, and it is natural to label a surface with the letter S . We distinguish a surface from its surface area by using a calligraphic S to denote a surface: . When writing this letter by hand, it may be useful to add serifs to the letter, such as:       Parametrized Surface   Let be a vector-valued function that is continuous and one to one on the interior of its domain in the - plane. The set of all terminal points of ( , the range of ) is the surface  , and along with its domain form a parametrization of .  This parametrization is smooth on if and are continuous and is never on the interior of . surface  parametric equations of a surface  parametrized surface  smooth surface  surface smooth     Given a point in the domain of a vector-valued function , the vectors and are tangent to the surface at (a proof of this is developed later in this section). The definition of smoothness dictates that ; this ensures that neither nor are , nor are they ever parallel. Therefore smoothness guarantees that and determine a plane that is tangent to .   Recall that function is one to one on its domain if the function never repeats an output value over the domain. In the case of , is one to one if for all points in the domain of . one to one    A surface is said to be orientable  orientable if a field of normal vectors can be defined on that vary continuously along . This definition may be hard to understand; it may help to know that orientable surfaces are often called two sided. A sphere is an orientable surface, and one can easily envision an inside and outside of the sphere. A paraboloid is orientable, where again one can generally envision inside and outside sides (or top and bottom sides) to this surface. Just about every surface that one can imagine is orientable, and we'll assume all surfaces we deal with in this text are orientable.   Möbius band It is enlightening to examine a classic non-orientable surface: the Möbius band, shown in Figure . Vectors normal to the surface are given, starting at the point indicated in the figure. These normal vectors vary continuously as they move along the surface. Letting each vector indicate the top side of the band, we can easily see near any vector which side is the top .  However, if as we progress along the band, we recognize that we are labeling both sides of the band as the top; in fact, there are not two sides to this band, but one. The Möbius band is a non-orientable surface.   A Möbius band, a non-orientable surface       We now practice parametrizing surfaces.   Parametrizing a surface over a rectangle   Parametrize the surface over the rectangular region defined by , .    There is a straightforward way to parametrize a surface of the form over a rectangular domain. We let and , and let . In this instance, we have , for , . This surface is graphed in Figure .   The surface parametrized in Example          Parametrizing a surface over a circular disk   Parametrize the surface over the circular region enclosed by the circle of radius 2 that is centered at the origin.    We can parametrize the circular boundary of with the vector-valued function , where . We can obtain the interior of by scaling this function by a variable amount, , by multiplying by : , where .  It is important to understand the role of in the above function. When , we get the boundary of , a circle of radius 2. When , we simply get the point , the center of (which can be thought of as a circle with radius of 0). When , we get the circle of radius that is centered at the origin, which is the circle halfway between the boundary and the center. As varies from 0 to 1, we create a series of concentric circles that fill out all of .   The surface parametrized in Example       Thus far, we have determined the and components of our parametrization of the surface: and . We find the component simply by using : .  Thus , , , which is graphed in Figure . The way that this graphic was generated highlights how the surface was parametrized. When viewing from above, one can see lines emanating from the origin; they represent different values of as sweeps from an angle of 0 up to . One can also see concentric circles, each corresponding to a different value of .     Examples and demonstrate an important principle when parametrizing surfaces given in the form over a region : if one can determine and in terms of and , then follows directly as .  In the following two examples, we parametrize the same surface over triangular regions. Each will use as a scaling factor as done in Example .   Parametrizing a surface over a triangle   Parametrize the surface over the triangular region enclosed by the coordinate axes and the line , as shown in Figure .   Part (a) shows a graph of the region , and part (b) shows the surface over , as defined in Example                     We may begin by letting , , and . This gives only the line on the upper side of the triangle. To get all of the region , we can once again scale by a variable factor, .  Still letting , , we let , . When , all -values are 0, and we get the portion of the -axis between and . When , we get the upper side of the triangle. When , we get the line , which is the line halfway up the triangle, shown in the figure with a dashed line.  Letting , we have , , . This surface is graphed in Figure . Again, when one looks from above, we can see the scaling effects of : the series of lines that run to the point each represent a different value of .  Another common way to parametrize the surface is to begin with , . Solving the equation of the line for , we have , leading to using , . With , we have , , .     Parametrizing a surface over a triangle   Parametrize the surface over the triangular region enclosed by the lines , and as shown in Figure .   Part (a) shows a graph of the region , and part (b) shows the surface over , as defined in Example                     While the region in this example is very similar to the region in the previous example, and our method of parametrizing the surface is fundamentally the same, it will feel as though our answer is much different than before.  We begin with letting , . We may be tempted to let , , but this is incorrect. When , we obtain the upper line of the triangle as desired. However, when , the -value is 0, which does not lie in the region .  We will describe the general method of proceeding following this example. For now, consider , . Note that when , we have , the upper line of the boundary of . Also, when , we have , which is the lower boundary of . With , we determine , , .  The surface is graphed in Figure .    Given a surface of the form , one can often determine a parametrization of the surface over a region in a manner similar to determining bounds of integration over a region . Using the techniques of Section , suppose a region can be described by , , , the area of can be found using the iterated integral .  When parametrizing the surface, we can let , , and we can let , . The parametrization of is straightforward, but look closely at how is determined. When , . When , .  As a specific example, consider the triangular region from Example , shown in Figure . Using the techniques of Section , we can find the area of as .  Following the above discussion, we can set , where , and set , , as used in that example.  One can do a similar thing if is bounded by , , but for the sake of simplicity we leave it to the reader to flesh out those details. The principles outlined above are given in the following Key Idea for reference.   Parametrizing Surfaces  Let a surface be the graph of a function , where the domain of is a closed, bounded region in the -plane. Let be bounded by , , , the area of can be found using the iterated integral , and let .   can be parametrized as .    Parametrizing a cylindrical surface   Find a parametrization of the cylinder , where , as shown in Figure .   The cylinder parametrized in Example         The equation can be envisioned to describe an ellipse in the -plane; as the equation lacks a -term, the equation describes a cylinder (recall Definition ) that extends without bound parallel to the -axis. This ellipse has a vertical major axis of length 4, a horizontal minor axis of length 2, and is centered at the origin. We can parametrize this ellipse using sines and cosines; our parametrization can begin with , where we still need to determine the component.  While the cylinder is satisfied by any value, the problem states that all values are to be between and . Since the value of does not depend at all on the values of or , we can use another variable, , to describe . Our final answer is .     Parametrizing an elliptic cone   Find a parametrization of the elliptic cone , where , as shown in Figure .   The elliptic cone as described in Example         One way to parametrize this cone is to recognize that given a value, the cross section of the cone at that value is an ellipse with equation . We can let , for and then parametrize the above ellipses using sines, cosines and .  We can parametrize the component of our surface with and the component with , where . Putting all components together, we have .  When takes on negative values, the radii of the cross-sectional ellipses become negative, which can lead to some surprising results. Consider Figure , where the cone is graphed for . Because is negative below the -plane, the radii of the cross-sectional ellipses are negative, and the opposite side of the cone is sketched below the -plane.   The elliptic cone as described in Example with restricted domain          Parametrizing an ellipsoid   Find a parametrization of the ellipsoid as shown in Figure .   An ellipsoid in (a), drawn again in (b) with its domain restricted, as described in Example                     Recall Key Idea from Section , which states that all unit vectors in space have the form for some angles and . If we choose our angles appropriately, this allows us to draw the unit sphere. To get an ellipsoid, we need only scale each component of the sphere appropriately.  The -radius of the given ellipsoid is 5, the -radius is 1 and the -radius is 2. Substituting for and for , we have , where we still need to determine the ranges of and .  Note how the and components of have and terms, respectively. This hints at the fact that ellipses are drawn parallel to the -plane as varies, which implies we should have range from to .  One may be tempted to let as well, but note how the component is . We only need to take on values between and once, therefore we can restrict to .  The final parametrization is thus .  In Figure , the ellipsoid is graphed on , to demonstrate how each variable affects the surface.    Parametrization is a powerful way to represent surfaces. One of the advantages of the methods of parametrization described in this section is that the domain of is always a rectangle; that is, the bounds on and are constants. This will make some of our future computations easier to evaluate.  Just as we could parametrize curves in more than one way, there will always be multiple ways to parametrize a surface. Some ways will be more natural than others, but these other ways are not incorrect. Because technology is often readily available, it is often a good idea to check one's work by graphing a parametrization of a surface to check if it indeed represents what it was intended to.    Surface Area   Tangent and normal vectors for parametric surfaces    It will become important in the following sections to be able to compute the surface area of a surface given a smooth parametrization , , . Following the principles given in the integration review at the beginning of this chapter, we can say that surface area of parametrized surface  , where represents a small amount of surface area. That is, to compute total surface area , add up lots of small amounts of surface area across the entire surface . The key to finding surface area is knowing how to compute . We begin by approximating.  In Section we used the area of a plane to approximate the surface area of a small portion of a surface. We will do the same here.  Let be the region of the - plane bounded by , as shown in Figure . Partition into rectangles of width and height , for some . Let be the lower left corner of some rectangle in the partition, and let and be neighboring corners as shown.  The point maps to a point on the surface , and the rectangle with corners , and maps to some region (probably not rectangular) on the surface as shown in Figure , where and . We wish to approximate the surface area of this mapped region.  Let and . These two vectors form a parallelogram, illustrated in Figure , whose area approximates the surface area we seek. In this particular illustration, we can see that parallelogram does not particularly match well the region we wish to approximate, but that is acceptable; by increasing the number of partitions of , and shrink and our approximations will become better.   Illustrating the process of finding surface area by approximating with planes                          From Section we know the area of this parallelogram is . If we repeat this approximation process for each rectangle in the partition of , we can sum the areas of all the parallelograms to get an approximation of the surface area : , where and .  From our previous calculus experience, we expect that taking a limit as will result in the exact surface area. However, the current form of the above double sum makes it difficult to realize what the result of that limit is. The following rewriting of the double summation will be helpful: .  We now take the limit as , forcing and to 0. As ,  .  (This limit process also demonstrates that and are tangent to the surface at . We don't need this fact now, but it will be important in the next section.)  Thus, in the limit, the double sum leads to a double integral: .   Surface Area of Parametrically Defined Surfaces   Let be a smooth parametrization of a surface over a closed, bounded region of the - plane. surface area of parametrized surface    The surface area differential is: .    The surface area of is .        Area of parametric surfaces     Finding the surface area of a parametrized surface   Using the parametrization found in Example , find the surface area of over the circular disk of radius 2, centered at the origin.    In Example , we parametrized the surface as , for , . To find the surface area using Theorem , we need . We find: .  Thus the surface area is .  There is a lot of tedious work in the above calculations and the final integral is nontrivial. The use of a computer-algebra system is highly recommended.     Surface area of a sphere    In Section , we recalled the arc length differential . In subsequent sections, we used that differential, but in most applications the part of the differential canceled out of the integrand (to our benefit, as integrating the square roots of functions is generally difficult). We will find a similar thing happens when we use the surface area differential in the following sections. That is, our main goal is not to be able to compute surface area; rather, surface area is a tool to obtain other quantities that are more important and useful. In our applications, we will use , but most of the time the part will cancel out of the integrand, making the subsequent integration easier to compute.

  "title": "Surface Integrals",
  "body": " Surface Integrals   Consider a smooth surface that represents a thin sheet of metal. How could we find the mass of this metallic object?  If the density of this object is constant, then we can find mass via mass density surface area, and we could compute the surface area using the techniques of the previous section.  What if the density were not constant, but variable, described by a function ? We can describe the mass using our general integration techniques as , where represents a little bit of mass. That is, to find the total mass of the object, sum up lots of little masses over the surface.  How do we find the little bit of mass  ? On a small portion of the surface with surface area , the density is approximately constant, hence . As we use limits to shrink the size of to 0, we get ; that is, a little bit of mass is equal to a density times a small amount of surface area. Thus the total mass of the thin sheet is .  To evaluate the above integral, we would seek , a smooth parametrization of over a region of the - plane. The density would become a function of and , and we would integrate .  The integral in Equation is a specific example of a more general construction defined below.    Surface integrals of scalar fields   The surface integral of a scalar field (function)     Surface Integral   Let be a continuous function defined on a surface . The surface integral of on is surface integral  .    Surface integrals can be used to measure a variety of quantities beyond mass. If measures the static charge density at a point, then the surface integral will compute the total static charge of the sheet. If measures the amount of fluid passing through a screen (represented by ) at a point, then the surface integral gives the total amount of fluid going through the screen.   Finding the mass of a thin sheet   Find the mass of a thin sheet modeled by the plane over the triangular region of the -plane bounded by the coordinate axes and the line , as shown in Figure , with density function , where all distances are measured in cm and the density is given as gm\/cm .   The surface whose mass is computed in Example         We begin by parametrizing the planar surface . Using the techniques of the previous section, we can let and , where and . Solving for in the equation of the plane, we have , hence , giving the parametrization .  We need , so we need to compute , and the norm of their cross product. We leave it to the reader to confirm the following: , .  We need to be careful to not simplify  as ; rather, it is . In this example, is bounded by , and on this interval . Thus .  The density is given as a function of , and , for which we'll substitute the corresponding components of (with the slight abuse of notation that we used in previous sections): .  Thus the mass of the sheet is:       Flux  Let a surface lie within a vector field . One is often interested in measuring the flux of across ; that is, measuring how much of the vector field passes across . For instance, if represents the velocity field of moving air and represents the shape of an air filter, the flux will measure how much air is passing through the filter per unit time. flux   As flux measures the amount of passing across , we need to find the amount of orthogonal to . Similar to our measure of flux in the plane, this is equal to , where is a unit vector normal to at a point. We now consider how to find .   Introducing surface integrals of vector fields    Given a smooth parametrization of , the work in the previous section showing the development of our method of computing surface area also shows that and are tangent to at . Thus is orthogonal to , and we let , which is a unit vector normal to at .  The measurement of flux across a surface is a surface integral; that is, to measure total flux we sum the product of times a small amount of surface area: .  A nice thing happens with the actual computation of flux: the terms go away. Consider: .  The above only makes sense if is orientable; the normal vectors must vary continuously across . We assume that does vary continuously. (If the parametrization of is smooth, then our above definition of will vary continuously.)   Flux over a surface   Let be a vector field with continuous components defined on an orientable surface with normal vector . The flux of across is flux  .  If is parametrized by , which is smooth on its domain , then .    Since is orientable, we adopt the convention of saying one passes from the back side of to the front side when moving across the surface parallel to the direction of . Also, when is closed, it is natural to speak of the regions of space inside and outside  . We also adopt the convention that when is a closed surface, should point to the outside of . If points inside , use instead.  When the computation of flux is positive, it means that the field is moving from the back side of to the front side; when flux is negative, it means the field is moving opposite the direction of , and is moving from the front of to the back. When is not closed, there is not a right and wrong direction in which should point, but one should be mindful of its direction to make full sense of the flux computation.  We demonstrate the computation of flux, and its interpretation, in the following examples.   Finding flux across a surface   Let be the surface given in Example , where is parametrized by on , , and let , as shown in Figure . Find the flux of across .   The surface and vector field used in Example         Using our work from the previous example, we have . We also need .  Thus the flux of across is: .  To make full use of this numeric answer, we need to know the direction in which the field is passing across . The graph in Figure helps, but we need a method that is not dependent on a graph.  Pick a point in the interior of and consider . For instance, choose and look at . This vector has positive , and components. Generally speaking, one has some idea of what the surface looks like, as that surface is for some reason important. In our case, we know is a plane with -intercept of . Knowing and the flux measurement of positive , we know that the field must be passing from behind  , , the side the origin is on, to the front of .     Computing a surface integral over part of a paraboloid     Flux across surfaces with shared boundaries   Let be the unit disk in the -plane, and let be the paraboloid , for , as graphed in Figure . Note how these two surfaces each have the unit circle as a boundary.   The surfaces used in Example       Let and . Using normal vectors for each surface that point upward,  , with a positive -component, find the flux of each field across each surface.    We begin by parametrizing each surface.  The boundary of the unit disk in the -plane is the unit circle, which can be described with , . To obtain the interior of the circle as well, we can scale by , giving .  As the boundary of is also the unit circle, the and components of will be the same as those of ; we just need a different component. With , we have , where and .  We now compute the normal vectors and .  For : , , so .  As this vector has a negative -component, we instead use .  Similarly, : , , so .  Again, this normal vector has a negative -component so we use .  We are now set to compute flux. Over field : . .  These two results are equal and positive. Each are positive because both normal vectors are pointing in the positive -directions, as does . As the field passes through each surface in the direction of their normal vectors, the flux is measured as positive.  We can also intuitively understand why the results are equal. Consider to represent the flow of air, and let each surface represent a filter. Since is constant, and moving straight up, it makes sense that all air passing through also passes through , and vice-versa.  If we treated the surfaces as creating one piecewise-smooth surface , we would find the total flux across by finding the flux across each piece, being sure that each normal vector pointed to the outside of the closed surface. Above, does not point outside the surface, though does. We would instead want to use in our computation. We would then find that the flux across is , and hence the total flux across is . (As is a special number, we should wonder if this answer has special significance. It does, which is briefly discussed following this example and will be more fully developed in the next section.)  We now compute the flux across each surface with : . .  This time the measurements of flux differ. Over , the field is just , hence there is no flux. Over , the flux is again positive as points in the positive direction over , as does .    In the previous example, the surfaces and form a closed surface that is piecewise smooth. That the measurement of flux across each surface was the same for some fields (and not for others) is reminiscent of a result from Section , where we measured flux across curves. The quick answer to why the flux was the same when considering is that . In the next section, we'll see the second part of the Divergence Theorem , which will more fully explain this occurrence. We will also explore Stokes' Theorem , the spatial analogue to Green's Theorem .  The videos in present some additional examples involving surface integrals of vector fields. Note that computing flux a cross a cube requires us to consider all six faces. This is a case where the Divergence Theorem can greatly simplify matters. For integrals over spheres, there are often simplifications possible, especially for radial vector fields (those parallel to the position vector ).   Computing flux across a cube     Some surface integrals over spheres       Terms and Concepts   In the plane, flux is a measurement of how much of the vector field passes across a ; in space, flux is a measurement of how much of the vector field passes across a .   curve; surface    When computing flux, what does it mean when the result is a negative number?   Answers will vary; in general, it means that more of the vector field passes through the surface opposite the direction of the normal vector than in the same direction of the normal vector.    When is a closed surface, we choose the normal vector so that it points to the of the surface.   outside    If is a plane, and is always parallel to , then the flux of across will be .

  "title": "The Divergence Theorem and Stokes' Theorem",
  "body": " The Divergence Theorem and Stokes' Theorem   The Divergence Theorem   Theorem gives the Divergence Theorem in the plane, which states that the flux of a vector field across a closed curve equals the sum of the divergences over the region enclosed by the curve. Recall that the flux was measured via a line integral, and the sum of the divergences was measured through a double integral.  We now consider the three-dimensional version of the Divergence Theorem. It states, in words, that the flux across a closed surface equals the sum of the divergences over the domain enclosed by the surface. Since we are in space (versus the plane), we measure flux via a surface integral, and the sums of divergences will be measured through a triple integral.   Introducing the Divergenge Theorem     The Divergence Theorem (in space)   Let be a closed domain in space whose boundary is an orientable, piecewise smooth surface with outer unit normal vector , and let be a vector field whose components are differentiable on . Then Divergence Theorem in space  .      Note: the term outer unit normal vector used in Theorem means points to the outside of . outer unit normal vector     Using the Divergence Theorem in space   Let be the domain in space bounded by the planes and , along with the cylinder , as graphed in Figure , let be the boundary of , and let .   The surfaces used in Example       Verify the Divergence Theorem by finding the total outward flux of across , and show this is equal to .    The surface is piecewise smooth, comprising surfaces , which is part of the plane , surface , which is part of the cylinder , and surface , which is part of the plane . To find the total outward flux across , we need to compute the outward flux across each of these three surfaces.  We leave it to the reader to confirm that surfaces , and can be parametrized by , and respectively as , where and for all three functions.  We compute a unit normal vector for each as , though recall that as we are integrating , we actually only use . Finally, in previous flux computations, it did not matter which direction pointed as long as we made note of its direction. When using the Divergence Theorem, we need to point to the outside of the closed surface, so in practice this means we'll either use or , depending on which points outside of the closed surface .  We leave it to the reader to confirm the following cross products and integrations are correct.  For , we need to use . (Note the -component is nonnegative as , therefore this vector always points up, meaning to the outside , of .) The flux across is: .  For , we use . (Note the -component is always nonnegative, meaning this vector points outside .) The flux across is: .  For , we use . (Note the -component is never positive, meaning this vector points down, outside of .) The flux across is: .  Thus the total outward flux, measured by surface integrals across all three component surfaces of , is . We now find the total outward flux by integrating over .  Following the steps outlined in Section , we see the bounds of , and can be set as (thinking surface to surface, curve to curve, point to point ): .  With , we find the total outward flux of over as: , the same result we obtained previously.    In Example we see that the total outward flux of a vector field across a closed surface can be found two different ways because of the Divergence Theorem. One computation took far less work to obtain. In that particular case, since was comprised of three separate surfaces, it was far simpler to compute one triple integral than three surface integrals (each of which required partial derivatives and a cross product). In practice, if outward flux needs to be measured, one would choose only one method. We will use both methods in this section simply to reinforce the truth of the Divergence Theorem.  We practice again in the following example.   Using the Divergence Theorem in space   Let be the surface formed by the paraboloid , , and the unit disk centered at the origin in the -plane, graphed in Figure , and let . (This surface and vector field were used in Example .)   The surfaces used in Example       Verify the Divergence Theorem; find the total outward flux across and evaluate the triple integral of , showing that these two quantities are equal.    We find the flux across first. As is piecewise-smooth, we decompose it into smooth components , the disk, and , the paraboloid, and find the flux across each.  In Example , we found the flux across is 0. We also found that the flux across is . (In that example, the normal vector had a positive component hence was an outer normal.) Thus the total outward flux is .  We now compute . We can describe as the domain bounded by (think surface to surface, curve to curve, point to point ): .  This description of is not very easy to integrate. With polar, we can do better. Let represent the unit disk, which can be described in polar simply as , where and . With and , the surface becomes .  Thus can be described as the domain bounded by: .  With , we can integrate, recalling that : , which matches our flux computation above.     A paradox of the Divergence Theorem and Gauss's Law   The magnitude of many physical quantities (such as light intensity or electromagnetic and gravitational forces) follow an inverse square law : the magnitude of the quantity at a point is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the source of the quantity. Gauss's Law   Let a point light source be placed at the origin and let be the vector field which describes the intensity and direction of the emanating light. At a point , the unit vector describing the direction of the light passing through that point is . As the intensity of light follows the inverse square law, the magnitude of at is for some constant . Taken together, .  Consider the cube, centered at the origin, with sides of length for some (hence corners of the cube lie at , , etc., as shown in Figure ). Find the flux across the six faces of the cube and compare this to .   The cube used in Example         Let be the top face of the cube, which can be parametrized by for , . We leave it to the reader to confirm that , which points outside of the cube.  The flux across this face is: .  Note how the result is independent of ; no matter the size of the cube, the flux through the top surface is always .  An argument of symmetry shows that the flux through each of the six faces is , thus the total flux through the faces of the cube is .  It takes a bit of algebra, but we can show that . Thus the Divergence Theorem would seem to imply that the total flux through the faces of the cube should be , but clearly this does not match the result from above. What went wrong?  Revisit the statement of the Divergence Theorem. One of the conditions is that the components of must be differentiable on the domain enclosed by the surface. In our case, is not differentiable at the origin it is not even defined! As does not satisfy the conditions of the Divergence Theorem, it does not apply, and we cannot expect .  Since is differentiable everywhere except the origin, the Divergence Theorem does apply over any domain that does not include the origin. Let be any surface that encloses the cube used before, and let be the domain between the cube and ; note how does not include the origin and so the Divergence Theorem does apply over this domain. The total outward flux over is thus , which means the amount of flux coming out of is the same as the amount of flux coming out of the cube. The conclusion: the flux across any surface enclosing the origin will be .  This has an important consequence in electrodynamics. Let be a point charge at the origin. The electric field generated by this point charge is , , it is with , where is a physical constant (the permittivity of free space ). Gauss's Law states that the outward flux of across any surface enclosing the origin is .     Exploring Gauss's Law    Our interest in the Divergence Theorem is twofold. First, its truth alone is interesting: to study the behavior of a vector field across a closed surface, one can examine properties of that field within the surface. Secondly, it offers an alternative way of computing flux. When there are multiple methods of computing a desired quantity, one has power to select the easiest computation as illustrated next.   Using the Divergence Theorem to compute flux   Let be the cube bounded by the planes , , , and let . Compute the outward flux of over .    We compute . By the Divergence Theorem, the outward flux is the triple integral over the domain enclosed by : .  The direct flux computation requires six surface integrals, one for each face of the cube. The Divergence Theorem offers a much more simple computation.      Stokes' Theorem  Just as the spatial Divergence Theorem of this section is an extension of the planar Divergence Theorem, Stokes' Theorem is the spatial extension of Green's Theorem. Recall that Green's Theorem states that the circulation of a vector field around a closed curve in the plane is equal to the sum of the curl of the field over the region enclosed by the curve. Stokes' Theorem effectively makes the same statement: given a closed curve that lies on a surface , the circulation of a vector field around that curve is the same as the sum of the curl of the field across the enclosed surface. We use quotes around the curl of the field to signify that this statement is not quite correct, as we do not sum , but , where is a unit vector normal to . That is, we sum the portion of that is orthogonal to at a point.   Introducing Stokes' Theorem    Green's Theorem dictated that the curve was to be traversed counterclockwise when measuring circulation. Stokes' Theorem will follow a right hand rule: when the thumb of one's right hand points in the direction of , the path will be traversed in the direction of the curling fingers of the hand (this is equivalent to traversing counterclockwise in the plane).   Stokes' Theorem   Let be a piecewise smooth, orientable surface whose boundary is a piecewise smooth curve , let be a unit vector normal to , let be traversed with respect to according to the right hand rule, and let the components of have continuous first partial derivatives over . Then Stokes' Theorem  .    In general, the best approach to evaluating the surface integral in Stokes' Theorem is to parametrize the surface with a function . We can find a unit normal vector as .  Since , the surface integral in practice is evaluated as , where may be replaced by to properly match the direction of this vector with the orientation of the parametrization of .   Verifying Stokes' Theorem   Considering the planar surface , let be the curve in space that lies on this surface above the circle of radius 1 and centered at in the -plane, let be the planar region enclosed by , as illustrated in Figure , and let . Verify Stoke's Theorem by showing .   As given in Example , the surface is the portion of the plane bounded by the curve         We begin by parametrizing and then find the circulation. A unit circle centered at can be parametrized with , on ; to put this curve on the surface , make the component equal : . All together, we parametrize with .  The circulation of around is .  We now parametrize . (We reuse the letter r for our surface as this is our custom.) Based on the parametrization of above, we describe with , where and .  We leave it to the reader to confirm that . As , this vector always has a non-negative -component, which the right-hand rule requires given the orientation of used above. We also leave it to the reader to confirm .  The surface integral of Stokes' Theorem is thus , which matches our previous result.     An example with Stokes' Theorem    One of the interesting results of Stokes' Theorem is that if two surfaces and share the same boundary, then . That is, the value of these two surface integrals is somehow independent of the interior of the surface. We demonstrate this principle in the next example.   Stokes' Theorem and surfaces that share a boundary   Let be the curve given in Example and note that it lies on the surface . Let be the region of this surface bounded by , and let as in the previous example. Compute to show it equals the result found in the previous example.   As given in Example , the surface \\surfaceS is the portion of the plane bounded by the curve                     We begin by demonstrating that lies on the surface . We can parametrize the and components of with , as before. Lifting these components to the surface gives the component as , which is the same component as found in Example . Thus the curve lies on the surface , as illustrated in Figure .  Since and are the same as in the previous example, we already know that . We confirm that this is also the value of .  We parametrize with , where and , and leave it to the reader to confirm that , which also conforms to the right-hand rule with regard to the orientation of . With as before, we have .  Even though the surfaces used in this example and in Example are very different, because they share the same boundary, Stokes' Theorem guarantees they have equal sum of curls across their respective surfaces.     Another example with Stokes' Theorem      A Common Thread of Calculus  We have threefold interest in each of the major theorems of this chapter: the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, Green's, Stokes' and the Divergence Theorems. First, we find the beauty of their truth interesting. Second, each provides two methods of computing a desired quantity, sometimes offering a simpler method of computation.  There is yet one more reason of interest in the major theorems of this chapter. These important theorems also all share an important principle with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, introduced in Chapter .  Revisit this fundamental theorem, adopting the notation used heavily in this chapter. Let be the interval and let be differentiable on , with . The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that .  That is, the sum of the rates of change of a function over an interval can also be calculated with a certain sum of itself on the boundary of (in this case, at the points and ).  Each of the named theorems above can be expressed in similar terms. Consider the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: given a function , the gradient is a type of rate of change of . Given a curve with initial and terminal points and , respectively, this fundamental theorem states that , where again the sum of a rate of change of along a curve can also be evaluated by a certain sum of at the boundary of ( , the points and ).  Green's Theorem is essentially a special case of Stokes' Theorem, so we consider just Stokes' Theorem here. Recalling that the curl of a vector field is a measure of a rate of change of , Stokes' Theorem states that over a surface bounded by a closed curve , , , the sum of a rate of change of can be calculated with a certain sum of itself over the boundary of . In this case, the latter sum is also an infinite sum, requiring an integral.  Finally, the Divergence Theorems state that the sum of divergences of a vector field (another measure of a rate of change of ) over a region can also be computed with a certain sum of over the boundary of that region. When the region is planar, the latter sum of is an integral; when the region is spatial, the latter sum of is a double integral.  The common thread among these theorems: the sum of a rate of change of a function over a region can be computed as another sum of the function itself on the boundary of the region. While very general, this is a very powerful and important statement.     Terms and Concepts   What are the differences between the Divergence Theorems of Section and this section?   Answers will vary; in Section , the Divergence Theorem connects outward flux over a closed curve in the plane to the divergence of the vector field, whereas in this section the Divergence Theorem connects outward flux over a closed surface in space to the divergence of the vector field.    What property of a vector field does the Divergence Theorem relate to flux?   Divergence.    What property of a vector field does Stokes' Theorem relate to circulation?   Curl.    Stokes' Theorem is the spatial version of what other theorem?   Green's Theorem.     Problems    In the following exercises, a closed surface enclosing a domain and a vector field are given.

The following exercises are designed to challenge your understanding and require no computation.    Let be any closed surface enclosing a domain . Consider and .  These fields are clearly very different. Why is it that the total outward flux of each field across is the same?   Each field has a divergence of 1; by the Divergence Theorem, the total outward flux across is for each field.       Green's Theorem can be used to find the area of a region enclosed by a curve by evaluating a line integral with the appropriate choice of vector field . What condition on makes this possible?

What condition on makes this possible?          .     , where is a unit vector normal to .       The Divergence Theorem establishes equality between a particular double integral and a particular triple integral. What types of circumstances would lead one to choose to evaluate the triple integral over the double integral?   Answers will vary. Often the closed surface is composed of several smooth surfaces. To measure total outward flux, this may require evaluating multiple double integrals. Each double integral requires the parametrization of a surface and the computation of the cross product of partial derivatives. One triple integral may require less work, especially as the divergence of a vector field is generally easy to compute.    Stokes' Theorem establishes equality between a particular line integral and a particular double integral. What types of circumstances would lead one to choose to evaluate the double integral over the line integral?   Answers will vary. Often the closed curve is composed of several smooth curves. To measure the total circulation, one may have to evaluate line integrals along each curve. Each line integral requires the parametrization of its curve. It may be less work to evaluate one single double ( , surface) integral.      "
