<div class="para">Taylor polynomials are used to approximate functions <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> in mainly two situations:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is known, but perhaps “hard” to compute directly. For instance, we can define the cosine of an angle as either the ratio of sides of a right triangle (“adjacent over hypotenuse”) or using the definition in terms of the unit circle. However, neither of these provides a convenient way of computing <span class="process-math">\(\cos(2)\text{.}\)</span> A Taylor polynomial of sufficiently high degree can provide a reasonable method of computing such values using only operations usually hard-wired into a computer (<span class="process-math">\(+\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(-\text{,}\)</span> <span class="times-sign">×</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\div\)</span>).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is not known, but information about its derivatives is known. This occurs more often than one might think, especially in the study of differential equations.</div></li>
