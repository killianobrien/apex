<div class="para">This type of exercise is rarely done by hand. Rather, it is simple to program a computer to run such an algorithm and stop when the endpoints differ by a preset small amount. One of the authors did write such a program and found the zero of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(0.7390851332\)</span> , accurate to <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> places after the decimal. While it took a few minutes to write the program, it took less than a thousandth of a second for the program to run the necessary <span class="process-math">\(35\)</span> iterations. In less than <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> hundredths of a second, the zero was calculated to <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> decimal places (with less than <span class="process-math">\(200\)</span> iterations).</div>
