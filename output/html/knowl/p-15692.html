<div class="para">There are some important concepts visited in this section that will be revisited in subsequent sections and again at the very end of this chapter. One is: given a vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\text{,}\)</span> both <span class="process-math">\(\divv\vec F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\curl\vec F\)</span> are measures of rates of change of <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\text{.}\)</span> The divergence measures how much the field spreads (diverges) at a point, and the curl measures how much the field twists (curls) at a point. Another important concept is this: given <span class="process-math">\(z=f(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> the gradient <span class="process-math">\(\nabla f\)</span> is also a measure of a rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> We will see how the integrals of these rates of change produce meaningful results.</div>
