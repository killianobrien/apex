<div class="para">We want to know the fastest the camera has to turn. Common sense tells us this is when the car is directly in front of the camera (i.e., when <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 0\)</span>). Our mathematics bears this out. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_rr4b.html" title="Equation 4.2.2">Equation (4.2.2)</a> we see this is when <span class="process-math">\(\cos^2(\theta)\)</span> is largest; this is when <span class="process-math">\(\cos(\theta) = 1\text{,}\)</span> or when <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 0\text{.}\)</span> We also know that we should get an answer that is in <span class="quantity"><sup>rad</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub></span>. Since <span class="process-math">\(\cos(\theta)\)</span> is a “dimensionless” measure, it won't contribute to the units. However, radians are also dimensionless. This means we can write (or erase) the word “radian” without any unit consequences. (The same is not true of degrees — always convert degress to radians).</div>
