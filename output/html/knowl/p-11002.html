<div class="para">Consider the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{PQ}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{RS}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_vectintro2.html" title="Figure 11.2.4">FigureÂ 11.2.4</a>. The vectors look to be equal; that is, they seem to have the same length and direction. Indeed, they are. Both vectors move 2 units to the right and 1 unit up from the initial point to reach the terminal point. One can analyze this movement to measure the magnitude of the vector, and the movement itself gives direction information (one could also measure the slope of the line passing through <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span>). Since they have the same length and direction, these two vectors are equal.</div>
