<div class="para">Now imagine driving a car and looking at the speedometer, which reads “<span class="quantity">60 mph</span>.” Five minutes later, you wonder how far you have traveled. Certainly, lots of things could have happened in those <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> minutes; you could have intentionally sped up significantly, you might have come to a complete stop, you might have slowed to <span class="quantity">20 mph</span> as you passed through construction. But suppose that you know, as the driver, none of these things happened. You know you maintained a fairly consistent speed over those <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> minutes. What is a good approximation of the distance traveled?</div>
