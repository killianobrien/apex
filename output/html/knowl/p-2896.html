<div class="para">We have seen that continuous functions on closed intervals always have a maximum and minimum value, and we have also developed a technique to find these values. In <a href="sec_mvt.html" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: The Mean Value Theorem">Section 3.2</a>, we further our study of the information we can glean from “nice” functions with the Mean Value Theorem. On a closed interval, we can find the <em class="emphasis">average rate of change</em> of a function (as we did at the beginning of <a href="chapter_derivatives.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Derivatives">Chapter 2</a>). We will see that differentiable functions always have a point at which their <em class="emphasis">instantaneous</em> rate of change is same as the <em class="emphasis">average</em> rate of change. This is surprisingly useful, as we'll see.</div>
