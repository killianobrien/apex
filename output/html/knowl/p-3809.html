<div class="para">If the radar gun is moving (say, attached to a police car) then radar readouts are only immediately understandable if the gun and the object are moving along the same line. If a police officer is traveling <span class="quantity">60 mph</span> and gets a readout of <span class="quantity">15 mph</span>, he knows that the car ahead of him is moving away at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> miles an hour, meaning the car is traveling <span class="quantity">75 mph</span>. (This straight-line principle is one reason officers park on the side of the highway and try to shoot straight back down the road. It gives the most accurate reading.)</div>
