<div class="para">We need to analyze this solution. When <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 2\pi/3\)</span> we obtain the point of intersection that lies in the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>th quadrant. When <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 4\pi/3\text{,}\)</span> we get the point of intersection that lies in the second quadrant. There is more to say about this second intersection point, however. The circle defined by <span class="process-math">\(r=\cos(\theta)\)</span> is traced out once on <span class="process-math">\([0,\pi]\text{,}\)</span> meaning that this point of intersection occurs while tracing out the circle a second time. It seems strange to pass by the point once and then recognize it as a point of intersection only when arriving there a “second time.” The first time the circle arrives at this point is when <span class="process-math">\(\theta = \pi/3\text{.}\)</span> It is key to understand that these two points are the same: <span class="process-math">\((\cos(\pi/3),\pi/3)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((\cos(4\pi/3),4\pi/3)\text{.}\)</span>
