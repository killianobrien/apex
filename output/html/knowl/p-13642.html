<div class="para">This may now make one wonder “What's the point? If we could already find the derivative, why learn another way of finding it?” In some cases, applying this rule makes deriving simpler, but this is hardly the power of the Chain Rule. Rather, in the case where <span class="process-math">\(z=f(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x=g(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=h(t)\text{,}\)</span> the Chain Rule is extremely powerful when <em class="emphasis">we do not know what <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and/or <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> are</em>. It may be hard to believe, but often in “the real world” we know rate-of-change information (i.e., information about derivatives) without explicitly knowing the underlying functions. The Chain Rule allows us to combine several rates of change to find another rate of change. The Chain Rule also has theoretic use, giving us insight into the behavior of certain constructions (as we'll see in the next section).</div>
