<div class="para">The image clearly displays a hyperboloid of two sheets. The gallery informs us that the equation will have a form similar to <span class="process-math">\(\frac{z^2}{c^2}-\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We can immediately eliminate option (a), as the constant in that equation is not 1.</div> <div class="para">The hyperboloid “opens” along the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, meaning <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must be the only variable with a positive coefficient, eliminating (c).</div> <div class="para">The hyperboloid is wider in the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-direction than in the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-direction, so we need an equation where <span class="process-math">\(c \gt b\text{.}\)</span> This eliminates (b), leaving us with (d). We should verify that the equation given in (d), <span class="process-math">\(4x^2-y^2-\frac{z^2}9=1\text{,}\)</span> fits.</div> <div class="para">We already established that this equation describes a hyperboloid of two sheets that opens in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-direction and is wider in the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-direction than in the <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Now note the coefficient of the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-term. Rewriting <span class="process-math">\(4x^2\)</span> in standard form, we have: <span class="process-math">\(\ds 4x^2 = \frac{x^2}{(1/2)^2}\text{.}\)</span> Thus when <span class="process-math">\(y=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z=0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must be <span class="process-math">\(1/2\text{;}\)</span> i.e., each hyperboloid “starts” at <span class="process-math">\(x=1/2\text{.}\)</span> This matches our figure.</div> <div class="para">We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\ds 4x^2-y^2-\frac{z^2}9=1\)</span> best fits the graph.</div>
