<a href="sec_derivative.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.1: Instantaneous Rates of Change: The Derivative">Section 2.1</a> started with an example of using the position of an object (in this case, a falling amusement park rider) to find the object's velocity. This type of example is often used when introducing the derivative because we tend to readily recognize that velocity is the <em class="emphasis">instantaneous rate of change in position.</em> In general, if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\fp(x)\)</span> measures the instantaneous rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Put another way, the derivative answers “When <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> changes, at what rate does <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> change?” Thinking back to the amusement park ride, we asked “When time changed, at what rate did the height change?” and found the answer to be “By <span class="process-math">\(-64\)</span> feet per second.”</div>
