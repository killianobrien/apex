<div class="para">A region is <em class="emphasis">simply connected</em>  if every simple closed curve that lies entirely in the region can be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a single point without leaving the region. (A curve is <em class="emphasis">simple</em>  if it does not cross itself.) In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_simply_connected_plane.html" title="Figure 15.3.19">Figure 15.3.19</a>, only set <span class="process-math">\(R_1\)</span> is simply connected. Region <span class="process-math">\(R_2\)</span> is not simply connected as any closed curve that goes around the “hole” in <span class="process-math">\(R_2\)</span> cannot be continuously shrunk to a single point. As <span class="process-math">\(R_3\)</span> is not even connected, it cannot be simply connected, though again it consists of two simply connected subregions.</div>
