<div class="para">It appears that all vectors that lie on a circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> centered at the  origin, have the same length (and indeed this is true). That implies that the divergence should be zero: draw any box on the graph, and any fluid coming in will lie along a circle that takes the same amount of fluid out. Indeed, the divergence is zero, as</div>

\begin{equation*}
\divv\vec F = \nabla \cdot \vec F = M_x + N_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(-y) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(x) = 0\text{.}

<div class="para">Clearly this field moves objects in a circle, but would it induce a cork to spin? It appears that yes, it would: place a cork anywhere in the flow, and the point of the cork closest to the origin would feel less flow than the point on the cork farthest from the origin, which would induce a counterclockwise flow. Indeed, the curl is positive:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\curl \vec F = \nabla\times\vec F = N_x-M_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(x) - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(-y) = 1-(-1) = 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Since the curl is constant, we conclude the induced spin is the same no matter where one is in this field.</div>
