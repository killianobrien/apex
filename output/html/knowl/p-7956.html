<div class="para">Recall than a linear algebraic equation in one variable is one that can be written <span class="process-math">\(ax + b = 0\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are real numbers. Notice that the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> appears to the first power. The equations <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x}+1=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sin(x)-3x = 0\)</span> are both nonlinear. A linear differential equation is one in which the dependent variable and its derivatives appear only to the first power. We focus on first order equations, which involve first (but not higher order) derivatives of the dependent variable.</div>
