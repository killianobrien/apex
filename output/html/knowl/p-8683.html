This gives us the result.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If the odd series converges, the work done in (a) shows the even series converges also. (The sequence of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th partial sum of the even series is bounded and monotonically increasing.) Likewise, (b) shows that if the even series converges, the odd series will, too. Thus if either series converges, the other does. Similarly, (a) and (b) can be used to show that if either series diverges, the other does, too.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If both the even and odd series converge, then their sum would be a convergent series. This would imply that the Harmonic Series, their sum, is convergent. It is not. Hence each series diverges.</div></li>
