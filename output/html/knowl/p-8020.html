<div class="para">We still begin with Newon's second law, but now we assume that the forces in the object come both from gravity and from air resistance. The gravitational force is still given by <span class="process-math">\(mg\text{.}\)</span> For air resistance, we assume the force is related to the velocity of the object. A simple way to describe this assumption might be <span class="process-math">\(kv^{p}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a proportionality constant and <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is a positive real number. The value <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> depends on various factors such as the density of the object, surface area of the object, and density of the air. The value <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> affects how changes in the velocity affect the force. Taken together, a function of the form <span class="process-math">\(kv^{p}\)</span> is often called a <em class="emphasis">power law</em>. The differential equation for the velocity is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
m\frac{dv}{dt} = mg - kv^{p}\text{.}
