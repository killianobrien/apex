<div class="para">Just as the spatial Divergence Theorem of this section is an extension of the planar Divergence Theorem, Stokes' Theorem is the spatial extension of Green's Theorem. Recall that Green's Theorem states that the circulation of a vector field around a closed curve in the plane is equal to the sum of the curl of the field over the region enclosed by the curve. Stokes' Theorem effectively makes the same statement: given a closed curve that lies on a surface <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\text{,}\)</span> the circulation of a vector field around that curve is the same as the sum of “the curl of the field” across the enclosed surface. We use quotes around “the curl of the field” to signify that this statement is not quite correct, as we do not sum <span class="process-math">\(\curl \vec F\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(\curl \vec F\cdot\vec n\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vec n\)</span> is a unit vector normal to <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\text{.}\)</span> That is, we sum the portion of <span class="process-math">\(\curl \vec F\)</span> that is orthogonal to <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> at a point.</div>
