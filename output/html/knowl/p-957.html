<div class="para">We now know what it means for a function to be continuous, so of course we can easily say what it means for a function to be <em class="emphasis">discontinuous</em>; namely, not continuous. However, to better understand continuity, it is worth our time to discuss the different ways in which a function can fail to be discontinuous. By definition, a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at a point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in its domain if <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a)\text{.}\)</span> If this equality fails to hold, then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous. We note, however, that there are a number of different things that can go wrong with this equality.</div>
