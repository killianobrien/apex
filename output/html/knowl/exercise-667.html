<div class="para">A standard soda can is roughly cylindrical and holds <span class="process-math">\({355\ {\rm cm^{3}}}\)</span> of liquid. A real-world soda can has material on the top and bottom that is thicker than the material around the side. Assume that the top/bottom material is twice as thick as the material around the side. What dimensions should the cylinder have to minimize the material needed to produce the can? Based on your dimensions and the assumption about material thickness, determine whether or not the standard can is produced to minimize the material costs.</div> <div class="para">Discuss whether or not your calculation suggests that a real world soda can is designed to minimize the materials cost.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_optimization.html#exercise-667" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
