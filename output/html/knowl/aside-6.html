<aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">We have defined what it means for a function to be continuous on an interval, but many functions, such as <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\tan(x)\text{,}\)</span> have domains that are the union of more than one interval.</div>
<div class="para">If the domain of a function is a union of intervals, saying that a function is continuous on its domain means that the function is continuous on each of those intervals. But be careful to note that the converse is not true. As we learned in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_contint2.html" title="Example 1.5.5: Finding intervals of continuity">ExampleÂ 1.5.5</a>, a function can be continuous on a collection of intervals, but not on their union.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_continuity.html#aside-6" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
