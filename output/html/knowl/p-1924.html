<div class="para">This theorem starts by stating an intuitive fact: constant functions have zero rate of change as they are <em class="emphasis">constant</em>. Therefore their derivative is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> (they change at the rate of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>). The theorem then states some fairly amazing things. The <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/power-derivative-rule.html" title="Item: Power Rule">Power Rule</a> states that the derivatives of Power Functions (of the form <span class="process-math">\(y=x^n\)</span>) are very straightforward: multiply by the power, then subtract <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> from the power. We see something incredible about the function <span class="process-math">\(y=e^x\text{:}\)</span> it is its own derivative. We also see a new connection between the sine and cosine functions.</div>
