<div class="para">Using the results from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_euler1.html" title="Example 8.1.19: Using Euler's Method 1">Examples 8.1.19</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_euler2.html" title="Example 8.1.21: Using Euler's Method 2">Example 8.1.21</a>, we can make a few observations about Euler's method. First, the Euler approximation generally gets worse as we get farther from the initial condition. This is because Euler's method involves two sources of error. The first comes from the fact that we're using a positive <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span>-value in the derivative approximation instead of using a limit as <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> approaches zero. Essentially, we're using a linear approximation to the solution <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> (similar to the process described in <a href="sec_differentials.html" class="internal" title="Section 4.4: Differentials">Section 4.4</a> on Differentials.) This error is often called the <em class="emphasis">local truncation error.</em> The second source of error comes from the fact that every step in Euler's method uses the result of the previous step. That means we're using an approximate <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value to approximate the next <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-value. Doing this repeatedly causes the errors to build on each other. This second type of error is often called the <em class="emphasis">propagated</em> or <em class="emphasis">accumulated error.</em> </div>
