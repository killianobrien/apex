<div class="para">There are specific techniques that can be used to solve specific types of differential equations. This is similar to solving algebraic equations. In algebra, we can use the quadratic formula to solve a quadratic equation, but not a linear or cubic equation. In the same way, techniques that can be used for a specific type of differential equation are often ineffective for a differential equation of a different type. In this section, we describe and practice a technique to solve a class of differential equations called <em class="emphasis">separable equations.</em>
