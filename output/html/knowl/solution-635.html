</div> <div class="para">This solution is a bit problematic. First, the absolute value makes the solution difficult to understand. The second issue comes from our desire to find the <em class="emphasis">general solution.</em> Recall that a general solution includes all possible solutions to the differential equation. In other words, for any given initial condition, the general solution must include the solution to that specific initial value problem. We can often satisfy any given initial condition by choosing an appropriate <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> value. When solving separable equations, though, it is possible to lose solutions that have the form <span class="process-math">\(y = \text{ constant}\text{.}\)</span> Notice that <span class="process-math">\(y=0\)</span> solves the differential equation, but it is not possible to choose a finite <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> to make our solution look like <span class="process-math">\(y=0\text{.}\)</span> Our solution cannot solve the initial value problem <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} = x^2y\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(y(a) = 0\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is any value). Thus, we haven't actually found a general solution to the problem. We can clean up the solution and recover the missing solution with a bit of clever thought.</div> <aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">Missing constant solutions can't always be recovered by cleverly redefining the arbitrary constant. The differential equation <span class="process-math">\(\yp = y^2 - 1\)</span> is an example of this fact. Both <span class="process-math">\(y=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=-1\)</span> are constant solutions to this differential equation. Separation of variables yields a solution where <span class="process-math">\(y=1\)</span> can be attained by choosing an appropriate <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> value, but <span class="process-math">\(y=-1\)</span> can't.

<div class="para">Recall the formal definition of the absolute value: <span class="process-math">\(\abs{y} = y\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(y \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\abs{y} =  -y\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(y \lt  0\text{.}\)</span> Our solution is either <span class="process-math">\(y = e^C e^{\frac{x^3}{3}}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(y = - e^C e^{{\frac{x^3}{3}}}\text{.}\)</span> Further, note that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is constant, so <span class="process-math">\(e^C\)</span> is also constant.

Finally, if we allow <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to be zero, we recover the missing solution discussed above. The best way to express the general solution to our differential equation is</div>
