<div class="para">One of the classic ways to build a mathematical model involves tracking the way the amount of something can change. We sometimes say these models are based on <em class="emphasis">conservation laws</em>. Consider a box with some amount of a specific type of material inside. (Some type of chemical, for example.) The amount of material of the specific type in the box can only change in four ways; we can add more to the box, we can remove some from the box, some of the material can change into material of a different type, or some other type of material can turn into the type we're tracking. In the examples that follow, we assume material doesn't change type, so we only need to keep track of material coming into the box and material leaving the box. To derive a differential equation, we track rates:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{ rate of change of some quantity }  = \text{ rate in }  - \text{ rate out }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
