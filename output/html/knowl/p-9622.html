<div class="para">In the previous example, the reader might be left wondering why we would bother with all that algebra, when the computer could have given us the result in seconds. One reason is simply that it lets us see how these different pieces fit together. Computing a Taylor polynomial by combining existing results will give the same polynomial as computing derivatives. Also we see that we can compute an approximation by replacing both parts of a composition with approximations. In the last couple of examples in this chapter, we see another reason: often we have to define functions in terms of power series derived through integration, or the solution of a differential equation, where there is no known function we can simply plug into the computer.</div>
