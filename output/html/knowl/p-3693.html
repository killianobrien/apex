<div class="para">While Newton's Method does not always work, it does work “most of the time,” and it is generally very fast. Once the approximations get close to the root, Newton's Method can as much as double the number of correct decimal places with each successive approximation. A course in Numerical Analysis will introduce the reader to more iterative root finding methods, as well as give greater detail about the strengths and weaknesses of Newton's Method.</div>
