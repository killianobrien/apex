We will soon give a theorem that states that a field <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> is conservative if, and only if, it is the gradient of some scalar function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> To show <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> is conservative, we need to determine whether or not <span class="process-math">\(\vec F = \nabla f\)</span> for some function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> (We'll later see that there is a yet simpler method). To recognize the special relationship between <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> in this situation, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is given a name.</div>
