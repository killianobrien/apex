<div class="para">We let <span class="process-math">\(y=0\)</span> represent the surface of the water; therefore the bottom of the plate is at <span class="process-math">\(y=-10\text{.}\)</span> We center the triangle on the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_fluid2b.html" title="Figure 7.6.9">FigureÂ 7.6.9</a>. The depth of the plate at <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-y\)</span> as indicated by the Key Idea. We now consider the length of the plate at <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> We need to find equations of the left and right edges of the plate. The right hand side is a line that connects the points <span class="process-math">\((0,-10)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((2,-6)\text{:}\)</span> that line has equation <span class="process-math">\(x=1/2(y+10)\text{.}\)</span> (Find the equation in the familiar <span class="process-math">\(y=mx+b\)</span> format and solve for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>) Likewise, the left hand side is described by the line <span class="process-math">\(x=-1/2(y+10)\text{.}\)</span> The total length is the distance between these two lines: <span class="process-math">\(\ell(y)=1/2(y+10) - (-1/2(y+10)) = y+10\text{.}\)</span>
