<div class="para">Linear functions are easy to work with; many functions that arise in the course of solving real problems are not easy to work with. A common practice in mathematical problem solving is to approximate difficult functions with not-so-difficult functions. Lines are a common choice. It turns out that at any given point on the graph of a differentiable function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> the best linear approximation to <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is its tangent line. That is one reason we'll spend considerable time finding tangent lines to functions.</div>
