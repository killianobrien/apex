<div class="para">When the computation of flux is positive, it means that the field is moving from the back side of <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> to the front side; when flux is negative, it means the field is moving opposite the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\vec n\text{,}\)</span> and is moving from the front of <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> to the back. When <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> is not closed, there is not a “right” and “wrong” direction in which <span class="process-math">\(\vec n\)</span> should point, but one should be mindful of its direction to make full sense of the flux computation.</div>
