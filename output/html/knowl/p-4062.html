<div class="para">Imagine water flowing down a winding channel. It is easy to measure the speed and direction (i.e., the <em class="emphasis">velocity</em>) of water at any location. It is very hard to create a function that describes the overall flow, hence it is hard to predict where a floating object placed at the beginning of the channel will end up. However, we can <em class="emphasis">approximate</em> the path of an object using differentials. Over small intervals, the path taken by a floating object is essentially linear. Differentials allow us to approximate the true path by piecing together lots of short, linear paths. This technique is called Euler's Method, studied in introductory Differential Equations courses.</div>
