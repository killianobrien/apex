<div class="para">The equation of the plane shows that the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec n = \la 2,1,1\ra\)</span> is a normal vector to the plane, and the equation of the line shows that the line moves parallel to <span class="process-math">\(\vec d = \la -1,2,1\ra\text{.}\)</span> Since these are not orthogonal, we know there is a point of intersection. (If there were orthogonal, it would mean that the plane and line were parallel to each other, either never intersecting or the line was in the plane itself.)</div>
