<div class="para">The previous section introduced the indefinite integral, which related to antiderivatives. We have now defined the definite integral, which relates to areas under a function. The two are very much related, as we'll see when we learn the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in <a href="sec_FTC.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.4: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus">Section 5.4</a>. Recall that earlier we said that the “<span class="process-math">\(\int\)</span>” symbol was an “elongated S” that represented finding a “sum.” In the context of the definite integral, this notation makes a bit more sense, as we are adding up areas under the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>
