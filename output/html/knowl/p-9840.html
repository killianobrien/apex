<div class="para">If each location has a clock set to the same time, hyperbolas can be used to determine the location. Suppose the microphone at position <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> records the sound at exactly 12:00, location <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> records the time exactly 1 second later, and location <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> records the noise exactly 2 seconds after that. We are interested in the <em class="emphasis">difference</em> of times. Since the speed of sound is approximately 340 m/s, we can conclude quickly that the sound was created 340 meters closer to position <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> than position <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are a known distance apart (as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_hyperbola_locatea.html" title="Figure 10.1.40.(a)">FigureÂ 10.1.40.(a)</a>), then we can determine a hyperbola on which <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> must lie.</div>
