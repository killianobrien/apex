<div class="para">We can clearly see in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_seq7c.html" title="Figure 9.1.(c)">FigureÂ 9.1.(c)</a>, where the sequence is plotted, that it is not monotonic. However, it does seem that after the first 4 terms it is decreasing. To understand why, perform the same analysis as done before:</div>

<div class="para">We want to know when this is greater than, or less than, 0. The denominator is always positive, therefore we are only concerned with the numerator.
