<div class="para">Going back to the very beginning of the section, we see that the only assumption we would need about our distance function <span class="process-math">\(f(t)\)</span> is that it be continuous and differentiable for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> hours (both reasonable assumptions). By the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_mvt.html" title="Theorem 3.2.4: The Mean Value Theorem of Differentiation">TheoremÂ 3.2.4</a>, we are guaranteed a time during the trip where our instantaneous speed is <span class="quantity">50 mph</span>. This fact is used in practice. Some law enforcement agencies monitor traffic speeds while in aircraft. They do not measure speed with radar, but rather by timing individual cars as they pass over lines painted on the highway whose distances apart are known. The officer is able to measure the <em class="emphasis">average</em> speed of a car between the painted lines; if that average speed is greater than the posted speed limit, the officer is assured that the driver exceeded the speed limit at some time.</div>
