<div class="para">Radar guns measure the rate of distance change between the gun and the object it is measuring. For instance, a reading of “<span class="quantity">55 mph</span>” means the object is moving away from the gun at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(55\)</span> miles per hour, whereas a measurement of “<span class="quantity">-25 mph</span>” would mean that the object is approaching the gun at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(25\)</span> miles per hour.</div> <div class="para">If the radar gun is moving (say, attached to a police car) then radar readouts are only immediately understandable if the gun and the object are moving along the same line. If a police officer is traveling <span class="quantity">60 mph</span> and gets a readout of <span class="quantity">15 mph</span>, he knows that the car ahead of him is moving away at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(15\)</span> miles an hour, meaning the car is traveling <span class="quantity">75 mph</span>. (This straight-line principle is one reason officers park on the side of the highway and try to shoot straight back down the road. It gives the most accurate reading.)</div> <div class="para">Suppose an officer is driving due north at <span class="quantity">30 mph</span> and sees a car moving due east, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_rr3.html" title="Figure 4.2.8">Figure 4.2.8</a>. Using his radar gun, he measures a reading of <span class="quantity">20 mph</span>. By using landmarks, he believes both he and the other car are about <span class="process-math">\(1/2\)</span> mile from the intersection of their two roads.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 47%; margin-left: 26.5%; margin-right: 26.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/img_rr3.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
