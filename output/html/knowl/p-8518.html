<div class="para">Consider once more the Harmonic Series <span class="process-math">\(\ds\infser \frac1n\)</span> which diverges; that is, the sequence of partial sums <span class="process-math">\(\{S_n\}\)</span> grows (very, very slowly) without bound. One might think that by removing the “large” terms of the sequence that perhaps the series will converge. This is simply not the case. For instance, the sum of the first 10 million terms of the Harmonic Series is about 16.7. Removing the first 10 million terms from the Harmonic Series changes the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th partial sums, effectively subtracting 16.7 from the sum. However, a sequence that is growing without bound will still grow without bound when 16.7 is subtracted from it.</div>
