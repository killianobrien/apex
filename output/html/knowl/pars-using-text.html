<section class="paragraphs"><h2 class="heading"><span class="title">A Note on Using this Text.</span></h2> <div class="para">Thank you for reading this short preface. Allow us to share a few key points about the text so that you may better understand what you will find beyond this page.</div> <div class="para">This text comprises a three—volume series on Calculus. The first part covers material taught in many “Calc 1” courses: limits, derivatives, and the basics of integration, found in Chapters 1 through 6.1. The second text covers material often taught in “Calc 2:” integration and its applications, including an introduction to differential equations, along with an introduction to sequences, series and Taylor Polynomials, found in Chapters 5 through 8. The third text covers topics common in “Calc 3” or “multivariable calc:” parametric equations, polar coordinates, vector-valued functions, and functions of more than one variable, found in Chapters 10 through 15. All three are available separately for free at <a class="external" href="https://apexcalculus.com" target="_blank">apexcalculus.com</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, and HTML versions of the book can be found at <a class="external" href="https://opentext.uleth.ca/calculus.html" target="_blank">opentext.uleth.ca</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>.</div> <div class="para">These three texts are intended to work together and make one cohesive text, <dfn class="terminology">APEX Calculus</dfn>, which can also be downloaded from the website.</div> <div class="para">Printing the entire text as one volume makes for a large, heavy, cumbersome book. One can certainly only print the pages they currently need, but some prefer to have a nice, bound copy of the text. Therefore this text has been split into these three manageable parts, each of which can be purchased for about $15 at <a class="external" href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="apex-preface.html#pars-using-text" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
