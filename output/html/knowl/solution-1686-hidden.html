<div class="para">From the outset, we should recognize that knowing <em class="emphasis">how to set up</em> this problem is probably more important than knowing <em class="emphasis">how to compute the integrals.</em> The iterated integral to come is not “hard” to evaluate, though it is long, requiring lots of algebra. Once the proper iterated integral is determined, one can use readily available technology to help compute the final answer.</div> <div class="para logical">
