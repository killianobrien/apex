<div class="para">If we treated the surfaces as creating one piecewise-smooth surface <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\text{,}\)</span> we would find the total flux across <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> by finding the flux across each piece, being sure that each normal vector pointed to the outside of the closed surface. Above, <span class="process-math">\(\vec n_1\)</span> does not point outside the surface, though <span class="process-math">\(\vec n_2\)</span> does. We would instead want to use <span class="process-math">\(-\vec n_1\)</span> in our computation. We would then find that the flux across <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS_1\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-\pi\text{,}\)</span> and hence the total flux across <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-\pi + \pi = 0\text{.}\)</span> (As <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is a special number, we should wonder if this answer has special significance. It does, which is briefly discussed following this example and will be more fully developed in the next section.)</div>
