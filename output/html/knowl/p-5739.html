<div class="para">One may have noticed that we have rules for integrating the familiar trigonometric functions and <span class="process-math">\(e^x\text{,}\)</span> but we have not yet given a rule for integrating <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x)\text{.}\)</span> That is because <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x)\)</span> can't easily be integrated with any of the rules we have learned up to this point. But we can find its antiderivative by a clever application of Integration by Parts. Set <span class="process-math">\(u=\ln(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv=dx\text{.}\)</span> This is a good, sneaky trick to learn as it can help in other situations. This determines <span class="process-math">\(du=(1/x)\,dx\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v=x\)</span> as shown below.</div>
