<div class="para">We use the rate in - rate out setup described above. The quantity here is the amount (in grams) of salt in the tank at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> denote the amount of salt. In words, the differential equation is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = \text{ rate in }  - \text{ rate out }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Thinking in terms of units can help fill in the details of the differential equation. Since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> has units of grams, the left hand side of the equation has units g/min. Both terms on the right hand side must have these same units. Notice that the product of a concentration (with units g/L) and a flow rate (with units L/min) results in a quantity with units g/min. Both terms on the right hand side of the equation will include a concentration multiplied by a flow rate.</div> <div class="para">For the rate in, we multiply the inflow concentration by the rate that fluid is flowing into the bucket. This is <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \left(3 \frac{\text{g} }{\text{L} }\right)\left(2 \frac{\text{L} }{\text{ min } }\right) = 6\)</span> g/min.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The rate out is more complicated. The flow rate is still <span class="quantity">2 <sup>L</sup>⁄<sub>min</sub></span>, meaning that the overall volume of the fluid in the bucket is the constant <span class="quantity">5 L</span>. The salt concentration in the bucket is not constant though, meaning that the outflow concentration is not constant. In particular, the outflow concentration is <em class="emphasis">not</em> the constant <span class="quantity">1 <sup>L</sup>⁄<sub>min</sub></span>. This is simply the initial concentration. To find the concentration at any time, we need the amount of salt in the bucket at that time and the volume of liquid in the bucket at that time. The volume of liquid is the constant <span class="quantity">5 L</span>, and the amount of salt is given by the dependent variable <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the outflow concentration is <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle \frac{y}{5}\)</span> g/L, yielding a rate out given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{y}{5}\frac{\text{ g } }{\text{ L } }\right)\left(2 \frac{\text{ L } }{\text{ min } }\right) = \frac{2y}{5}\text{ g/min }\text{.}
