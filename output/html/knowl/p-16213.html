<div class="para">In the previous example, the surfaces <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS_2\)</span> form a closed surface that is piecewise smooth. That the measurement of flux across each surface was the same for some fields (and not for others) is reminiscent of a result from <a href="sec_greensthm.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.4: Flow, Flux, Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem">SectionÂ 15.4</a>, where we measured flux across curves. The quick answer to why the flux was the same when considering <span class="process-math">\(\vec F_1\)</span> is that <span class="process-math">\(\divv \vec F_1 = 0\text{.}\)</span> In the next section, we'll see the second part of the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_divergence2.html" title="Theorem 15.7.2: The Divergence Theorem (in space)">Divergence Theorem</a>, which will more fully explain this occurrence. We will also explore <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_stokes_thm.html" title="Theorem 15.7.12: Stokes' Theorem">Stokes' Theorem</a>, the spatial analogue to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_greens.html" title="Theorem 15.4.8: Green's Theorem">Green's Theorem</a>.</div>
