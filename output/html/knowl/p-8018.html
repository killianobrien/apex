<div class="para">The process of mathematical modeling does not stop simply because we have found an answer. We must examine the answer to see how well it can describe real world observations. In the previous example, the answer may be somewhat useful for short times, but intuition tells us that something is missing. Our answer says that a falling object's velocity will increase linearly as a function of time, but we know that a falling object does not speed up indefinitely. In order to more fully describe real world behavior, our mathematical model must be revised.</div>
