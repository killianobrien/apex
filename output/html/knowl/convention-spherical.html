<div class="para">Note that most mathematics textbooks define <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> to be measured from the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis, with values in <span class="process-math">\([0,\pi]\text{,}\)</span> rather than from the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We have chosen our convention with a number of considerations in mind:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">The coordinates <span class="process-math">\((\rho,\theta,\varphi)\)</span> form a <dfn class="terminology">right-handed</dfn> coordinate system: one in which the orientation matches that of our usual <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> coordinates, where the “right-hand rule” applies. If <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is measured from the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis, the order <span class="process-math">\((\rho, \varphi, \theta)\)</span> is needed to get a right-handed system.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Points of the form <span class="process-math">\((a,\alpha,0)\)</span> are the same in both cylindrical and spherical coordinates.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Some integration problems become slightly easier: we will see soon that the volume element in spherical coordinates involves <span class="process-math">\(\cos(\varphi)\text{,}\)</span> which integrates to <span class="process-math">\(\sin(\varphi)\text{.}\)</span> In the usual convention, the volume element involves <span class="process-math">\(\sin(\varphi)\text{,}\)</span> which integrates to <span class="process-math">\(-\cos(\varphi)\)</span> – a source of many common sign errors.</div></li>
</ul>
</div> <div class="para">Students of Physics will encounter yet another convention. In Physics, the variable <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is preferred as the radial coordinate, and spherical coordinates are given as <span class="process-math">\((r,\theta,\varphi)\text{;}\)</span> however, in Physics, <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> becomes the angle in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane, while <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle measured from the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis.</div> <div class="para">Note that the angle in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane (<span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> in our case) is known as the <dfn class="terminology">azimuthal angle</dfn>. Our angle <span class="process-math">\(\varphi\)</span> is known as the <dfn class="terminology">elevation angle</dfn>. The angle used in other conventions that is measured from the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis (often identified with the north pole) is known as the <dfn class="terminology">polar angle</dfn>.
