<a href="sec_basic_diff_rules.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.3: Basic Differentiation Rules">SectionÂ 2.3</a> showed that, in some ways, derivatives behave nicely. The <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/constant-multiple-derivative-rule.html" title="Item: Constant Multiple Rule">Constant Multiple Rule</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/sum-difference-derivative-rule.html" title="Item: Sum/Difference Rule">Sum/Difference Rule</a> established that the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 5x^2+\sin(x)\)</span> was not complicated. We neglected computing the derivative of things like <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = 5x^2\sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = \frac{5x^2}{\sin(x) }\)</span> on purpose; their derivatives are <em class="emphasis">not</em> as straightforward. (If you had to guess what their respective derivatives are, you would probably guess wrong.) For these, we need the Product and Quotient Rules, respectively, which are defined in this section. We begin with the Product Rule.</div>
