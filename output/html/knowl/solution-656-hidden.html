<div class="para">The intuition behind the assumption here is that a disease can only spread if there are individuals who are susceptible to the infection. As fewer and fewer people are able to be infected, the disease spread should slow down. Since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is proportion of the population that is sick, <span class="process-math">\(1-y\)</span> is the proportion who are not sick, and the differential equation is</div>
