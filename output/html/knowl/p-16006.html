<div class="para">A surface <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> is said to be <em class="emphasis">orientable</em>  if a field of normal vectors can be defined on <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> that vary continuously along <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\text{.}\)</span> This definition may be hard to understand; it may help to know that orientable surfaces are often called “two sided.” A sphere is an orientable surface, and one can easily envision an “inside” and “outside” of the sphere. A paraboloid is orientable, where again one can generally envision “inside” and “outside” sides (or “top” and “bottom” sides) to this surface. Just about every surface that one can imagine is orientable, and we'll assume all surfaces we deal with in this text are orientable.</div>
