<div class="para">As mentioned before, practice helps one develop the intuition to quickly choose a series with which to compare. A general rule of thumb is to pick a series based on the dominant term in the expression of <span class="process-math">\(\{a_n\}\text{.}\)</span> It is also helpful to note that factorials dominate exponentials, which dominate algebraic functions (e.g., polynomials), which dominate logarithms. In the previous example, the dominant term of <span class="process-math">\(\ds\frac{1}{3^n-n^2}\)</span> was <span class="process-math">\(3^n\text{,}\)</span> so we compared the series to <span class="process-math">\(\ds \infser \frac1{3^n}\text{.}\)</span> It is hard to apply the Limit Comparison Test to series containing factorials, though, as we have not learned how to apply L'Hospital's Rule to <span class="process-math">\(n!\text{.}\)</span>
