<div class="para">Now consider <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\text{,}\)</span> a velocity function. That is, at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\)</span> gives the velocity of an object. The derivative of <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v'(t)\text{,}\)</span> gives the <em class="emphasis">instantaneous rate of velocity change with respect to time</em> — <em class="emphasis">acceleration</em>. (We often think of acceleration in terms of cars: a car may “go from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(60\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(4.8\)</span> seconds.” This is an <em class="emphasis">average</em> acceleration, a measurement of how quickly the velocity changed.) If velocity is measured in feet per second, and time is measured in seconds, then the units of acceleration (i.e., the units of <span class="process-math">\(v'(t)\)</span>) are “feet per second per second,” or <span class="process-math">\((\)</span>ft/s<span class="process-math">\()\)</span>/s. We often shorten this to “feet per second squared,” or <span class="quantity"><sup>ft</sup>⁄<sub>s<sup>2</sup></sub></span>, but this tends to obscure the meaning of the units. </div>
