<div class="para">All this leads us to a definition. The integral found in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_line0.html" title="Equation 15.1.1">Equation (15.1.1)</a> is called a <em class="emphasis">line integral</em>. We formally define it below, but note that the definition is very abstract. On one hand, one is apt to say “the definition makes sense,” while on the other, one is equally apt to say “but I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this definition.” We'll address that after the definition, and actually find an answer to the area problem we posed at the beginning of this section.</div>
