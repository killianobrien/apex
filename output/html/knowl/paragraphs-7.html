This pseudo-definition glosses over some of the finer points of continuity. There are some very strange continuous functions that one would be hard pressed to actually sketch by hand.</div> <div class="para">However, this intuitive notion of continuity does help us understand another important concept as follows. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is defined on <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(1) = -10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(2) = 5\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous on <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\)</span> (i.e., its graph can be sketched as a continuous curve from <span class="process-math">\((1,-10)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((2,5)\)</span>) then we know intuitively that somewhere on the interval <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must be equal to <span class="process-math">\(-9\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-8\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-7,-6,\ldots,0,1/2\text{,}\)</span> etc. In short, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> takes on all <em class="emphasis">intermediate</em> values between <span class="process-math">\(-10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> It may take on more values; <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> may actually equal <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> at some time, for instance, but we are guaranteed all values between <span class="process-math">\(-10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span>

Good approximations can be found through successive applications of this theorem.

<div class="para">There is a technique that produces a good approximation of <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> be the midpoint of the interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(f(a) \lt 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(b) \gt 0\)</span> and consider <span class="process-math">\(f(d)\text{.}\)</span> There are three possibilities:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f(d) = 0\text{:}\)</span> We got lucky and stumbled on the actual value. We stop as we found a root.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f(d) \lt 0\text{:}\)</span> Then we know there is a root of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on the interval <span class="process-math">\([d,b]\)</span> — we have halved the size of our interval, hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">

</div></article>  <div class="para">It is a simple matter to extend the Bisection Method to solve problems similar to “Find <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span>” For instance, we can find <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 1\text{.}\)</span> It actually works very well to define a new function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = f(x) - 1\text{.}\)</span> Then use the Bisection Method to solve <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Similarly, given two functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> we can use the Bisection Method to solve <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = g(x)\text{.}\)</span> Once again, create a new function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = f(x)-g(x)\)</span> and solve <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span>
