<div class="para">One could argue that just finding critical values is important; once we know the significant points are <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1/3\text{,}\)</span> the graph shows the increasing/decreasing traits just fine. That is true. However, the technique prescribed here helps reinforce the relationship between increasing/decreasing and the sign of <span class="process-math">\(\fp\text{.}\)</span> Once mastery of this concept (and several others) is obtained, one finds that either (a) just the critical points are computed and the graph shows all else that is desired, or (b) a graph is never produced, because determining increasing/decreasing using <span class="process-math">\(\fp\)</span> is straightforward and the graph is unnecessary. So our second reason why the above work is worthwhile is this: once mastery of a subject is gained, one has <em class="emphasis">options</em> for finding needed information. We are working to develop mastery.</div>
