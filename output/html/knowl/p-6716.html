<div class="para">This chapter has explored many integration techniques. We learned Substitution, which “undoes” the Chain Rule of differentiation, as well as Integration by Parts, which “undoes” the Product Rule. We learned specialized techniques for handling trigonometric functions and introduced the hyperbolic functions, which are closely related to the trigonometric functions. All techniques effectively have this goal in common: rewrite the integrand in a new way so that the integration step is easier to see and implement.</div>
