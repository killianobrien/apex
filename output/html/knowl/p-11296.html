<div class="para">The term <em class="emphasis">perpendicular</em> originally referred to lines. As mathematics progressed, the concept of “being at right angles to” was applied to other objects, such as vectors and planes, and the term <em class="emphasis">orthogonal</em> was introduced. It is especially used when discussing objects that are hard, or impossible, to visualize: two vectors in 5-dimensional space are orthogonal if their dot product is 0. It is not wrong to say they are <em class="emphasis">perpendicular</em>, but common convention gives preference to the word <em class="emphasis">orthogonal</em>.</div>
