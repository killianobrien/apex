<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS_1\)</span> be the “top” face of the cube, which can be parametrized by <span class="process-math">\(\vec r(u,v) = \langle u,v,a\rangle\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(-a\leq u\leq a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(-a\leq v\leq a\text{.}\)</span> We leave it to the reader to confirm that <span class="process-math">\(\vec r_u\times \vec r_v = \langle 0,0,1\rangle\text{,}\)</span> which points outside of the cube.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The flux across this face is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\text{ Flux }  \amp = \iint_{\surfaceS_1} \vec F\cdot \vec n\, dS\\
\amp = \int_{-a}^a\int_{-a}^a \vec F\big(\vec r(u,v)\big)\cdot \big(\vec r_u\times \vec r_v\big)\, du\, dv\\

<p class="intertext">This double integral is <em class="emphasis">not</em> trivial to compute, requiring multiple trigonometric substitutions. This example is not meant to stress integration techniques, so we leave it to the reader to confirm the result is</p>

\amp = \frac{2k\pi}3\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Note how the result is independent of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{;}\)</span> no matter the size of the cube, the flux through the top surface is always <span class="process-math">\(2k\pi/3\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">An argument of symmetry shows that the flux through each of the six faces is <span class="process-math">\(2k\pi/3\text{,}\)</span> thus the total flux through the faces of the cube is <span class="process-math">\(6\times2k\pi/3 = 4k\pi\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">It takes a bit of algebra, but we can show that <span class="process-math">\(\divv\vec F = 0\text{.}\)</span> Thus the Divergence Theorem would seem to imply that the total flux through the faces of the cube should be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{ Flux } =\iiint_D \divv \vec F\, dV = \iiint_D 0\, dV = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">but clearly this does not match the result from above. What went wrong?</div>
</div> <div class="para">Revisit the statement of the Divergence Theorem. One of the conditions is that the components of <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> must be differentiable on the domain enclosed by the surface. In our case, <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">not</em> differentiable at the origin — it is not even defined! As <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> does not satisfy the conditions of the Divergence Theorem, it does not apply, and we cannot expect <span class="process-math">\(\iint_\surfaceS \vec F\cdot\vec n\, dA = \iiint_D \divv\vec F\, dV\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> is differentiable everywhere except the origin, the Divergence Theorem does apply over any domain that does not include the origin. Let <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS_2\)</span> be any surface that encloses the cube used before, and let <span class="process-math">\(\hat D\)</span> be the domain <em class="emphasis">between</em> the cube and <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS_2\text{;}\)</span> note how <span class="process-math">\(\hat D\)</span> does not include the origin and so the Divergence Theorem does apply over this domain. The total outward flux over <span class="process-math">\(\hat D\)</span> is thus <span class="process-math">\(\iint_{\hat D}\divv \vec F\, dV = 0\text{,}\)</span> which means the amount of flux coming out of <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS_2\)</span> is the same as the amount of flux coming out of the cube. The conclusion: the flux across <em class="emphasis">any</em> surface enclosing the origin will be <span class="process-math">\(4k\pi\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">This has an important consequence in electrodynamics. Let <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> be a point charge at the origin. The electric field generated by this point charge is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\vec E = \frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{\la x,y,z\ra}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}}\text{,}

</div>
<div class="para">i.e., it is <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k = q/(4\pi \epsilon_0)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is a physical constant (the “permittivity of free space”). Gauss's Law states that the outward flux of <span class="process-math">\(\vec E\)</span> across any surface enclosing the origin is <span class="process-math">\(q/\epsilon_0\text{.}\)</span>
