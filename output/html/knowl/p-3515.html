<div class="para">We are attempting to understand the behavior of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> based on the information given by its derivatives. While all of a function's derivatives relay information about it, it turns out that “most” of the behavior we care about is explained by <span class="process-math">\(\fp\)</span>and <span class="process-math">\(\fpp\text{.}\)</span> Understanding the interactions between the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\fp\)</span>and <span class="process-math">\(\fpp\)</span>is important. To gain this understanding, one might argue that all that is needed is to look at lots of graphs. This is true to a point, but is somewhat similar to stating that one understands how an engine works after looking only at pictures. It is true that the basic ideas will be conveyed, but “hands-on” access increases understanding.</div>
