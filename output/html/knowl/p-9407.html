<div class="para">We again find an interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> that contains both <span class="process-math">\(c=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{;}\)</span> we choose <span class="process-math">\(I = (0.9,2.1)\text{.}\)</span> The maximum value of the seventh derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on this interval is again about 1506 (as the largest values come near <span class="process-math">\(x=0.9\)</span>).

<div class="para">This bound is not as nearly as good as before. Using the degree 6 Taylor polynomial at <span class="process-math">\(x =1\)</span> will bring us within 0.3 of the correct answer. As <span class="process-math">\(p_6(2)\approx 0.61667\text{,}\)</span> our error estimate guarantees that the actual value of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\)</span> is somewhere between <span class="process-math">\(0.31667\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0.91667\text{.}\)</span> These bounds are not particularly useful. In reality, our approximation was only off by about 0.07. However, we are approximating ostensibly because we do not know the real answer. In order to be assured that we have a good approximation, we would have to resort to using a polynomial of higher degree.</div>
