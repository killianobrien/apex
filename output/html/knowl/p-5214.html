<div class="para">At the beginning of this section we mentioned two main situations where numerical integration was desirable. We have considered the case where an antiderivative of the integrand cannot be computed. We now investigate the situation where the integrand is not known. This is, in fact, the most widely used application of Numerical Integration methods. “Most of the time” we observe behavior but do not know “the” function that describes it. We instead collect data about the behavior and make approximations based on this data. We demonstrate this in an example.</div>
