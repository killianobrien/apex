<div class="para">In practice, technology helps greatly in the evaluation of such integrals. High powered computer algebra systems can compute integrals that are difficult, or at least time consuming, by hand, and can at the least produce very accurate approximations with numerical methods. In general, just knowing <em class="emphasis">how</em> to set up the proper integrals brings one very close to being able to compute the needed value. Most of the work is actually done in just describing the region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> in terms of polar or rectangular coordinates. Once this is done, technology can usually provide a good answer.</div>
