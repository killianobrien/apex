<div class="para">Consider a disk of radius 1 with uniform density. It is common knowledge that the disk will balance on a point if the point is placed at the center of the disk. What if the disk does not have a uniform density? Through trial-and-error, we should still be able to find a spot on the disk at which the disk will balance on a point. This balance point is referred to as the <em class="emphasis">center of mass</em>, or <em class="emphasis">center of gravity</em>. It is though all the mass is “centered” there. In fact, if the disk has a mass of <span class="quantity">3 kg</span>, the disk will behave physically as though it were a point-mass of <span class="quantity">3 kg</span> located at its center of mass. For instance, the disk will naturally spin with an axis through its center of mass (which is why it is important to “balance” the tires of your car: if they are “out of balance”, their center of mass will be outside of the axle and it will shake terribly). </div>
