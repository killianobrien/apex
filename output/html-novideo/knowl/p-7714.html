<div class="para">The function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> could be any function of the two variables <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Written in this way, we can think of the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as providing a formula to find the slope of a solution at a given point in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. In other words, suppose a solution to the differential equation passes through the point <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\text{.}\)</span> At the point <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\text{,}\)</span> the slope of the solution curve will be <span class="process-math">\(f(x_0,y_0)\text{.}\)</span> Since this calculation of the slope is possible at any point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> where the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y)\)</span> is defined, we can produce a plot called a <em class="emphasis">slope field</em> (or direction field) that shows the slope of a solution at any point in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane where the solution is defined. Further, this process can be done purely by working with the differential equation itself. In other words, we can draw a slope field and use it to determine the qualitative behavior of solutions to a differential equation without having to solve the differential equation. </div>
