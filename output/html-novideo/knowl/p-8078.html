<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_disease_exponential.html" title="Example 8.4.4: Disease Spread 1">Example 8.4.4</a>, we assumed disease spread depends on the number of infected individuals. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_disease_newton.html" title="Example 8.4.5: Disease Spread 2">Example 8.4.5</a>, we assumed disease spread depends on the number of susceptible individuals who are able to become infected. In reality, we would expect many diseases to require the interaction of both infected and susceptible individuals in order to spread. One of the simplest ways to model this required interaction is to assume disease spread depends on the product of the proportions of infected and uninfected individuals. This assumption (regularly seen in the context of chemical reactions) is often called the <em class="emphasis">law of mass action.</em>
