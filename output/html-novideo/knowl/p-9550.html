<div class="para">There is good news. A function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> that is equal to its Taylor series, centered at any point the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> is said to be an <em class="emphasis">analytic function</em>,  and most, if not all, functions that we encounter within this course are analytic functions. Generally speaking, any function that one creates with elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc.) that is not piecewise defined is probably analytic. For most functions, we assume the function is equal to its Taylor series on the series' interval of convergence and only use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_function_series_equality.html" title="Theorem 9.8.6: Function and Taylor Series Equality">TheoremÂ 9.8.6</a> when we suspect something may not work as expected.</div>
