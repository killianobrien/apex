<div class="para">It may be surprising to find that the problem of representing a three dimensional surface on paper is familiar to most people (they just don't realize it).  Topographical maps, like the one shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_topomap.html" title="Figure 13.1.6">Figure 13.1.6</a>, represent the surface of Earth by indicating points with the same elevation with <em class="emphasis">contour lines</em>. The elevations marked are equally spaced; in this example, each thin line indicates an elevation change in 50ft increments and each thick line indicates a change of 200ft. When lines are drawn close together, elevation changes rapidly (as one does not have to travel far to rise 50ft). When lines are far apart, such as near “Aspen Campground,” elevation changes more gradually as one has to walk farther to rise 50ft.</div>
