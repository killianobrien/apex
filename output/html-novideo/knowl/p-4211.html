<div class="para">Hopefully you were able to come up with at least one solution: <span class="process-math">\(y = x^2\text{.}\)</span> “Finding another” may have seemed impossible until one realizes that a function like <span class="process-math">\(y=x^2+1\)</span> also has a derivative of <span class="process-math">\(2x\text{.}\)</span> Once that discovery is made, finding “yet another” is not difficult; the function <span class="process-math">\(y = x^2 + 123{,}456{,}789\)</span> also has a derivative of <span class="process-math">\(2x\text{.}\)</span> The differential equation <span class="process-math">\(y' = 2x\)</span> has many solutions. This leads us to some definitions.</div>
