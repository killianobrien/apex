<div class="para">For instance, the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, â€¦, form a sequence. The order is important; the first number is 2, the second is 4, etc. It seems natural to seek a formula that describes a given sequence, and often this can be done. For instance, the sequence above could be described by the function <span class="process-math">\(a(n) = 2n\text{,}\)</span> for the values of <span class="process-math">\(n = 1, 2, \ldots\)</span> To find the <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span>th term in the sequence, we would compute <span class="process-math">\(a(10)\text{.}\)</span> This leads us to the following, formal definition of a sequence.</div>
