<div class="para">To solve, we integrate the left hand side with respect to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and the right hand side with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and add a constant of integration. As long as we are able to find the antiderivatives, we can find an implicit form for the solution. Sometimes we are able to solve for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the implicit solution to find an explicit form of the solution to the differential equation. We practice the technique by solving the three differential equations listed in the separable column above, and conclude by revisiting and finding the general solution to the logistic differential equation from <a href="sec_Graphical_Numerical.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.1: Graphical and Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations">SectionÂ 8.1</a>.</div>
