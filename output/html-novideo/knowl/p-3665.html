<div class="para">Our approximations <span class="process-math">\(x_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x_3\)</span> did not differ for at least the first five places after the decimal, so we could have stopped. However, using our calculator in the manner described is easy, so finding <span class="process-math">\(x_4\)</span> was not hard. It is interesting to see how we found an approximation, accurate to as many decimal places as our calculator displays, in just four iterations.</div>
