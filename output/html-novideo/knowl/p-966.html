<div class="para">One important application of the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_IVT.html" title="Theorem 1.5.14: Intermediate Value Theorem">Intermediate Value Theorem</a> is root finding. Given a function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> we are often interested in finding values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span> These roots may be very difficult to find exactly. Good approximations can be found through successive applications of this theorem. Suppose through direct computation we find that <span class="process-math">\(f(a) \lt 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(b)\gt 0\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\lt b\text{.}\)</span> The <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_IVT.html" title="Theorem 1.5.14: Intermediate Value Theorem">Intermediate Value Theorem</a> states that there is at least one <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(c) = 0\text{.}\)</span> The theorem does not give us any clue as to where to find such a value in the interval <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{,}\)</span> just that at least one such value exists.</div>
