<div class="para">We have seen a practical use of differentials as they offer a good method of making certain approximations. Another use is <em class="emphasis">error propagation.</em> Suppose a length is measured to be <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> although the actual value is <span class="process-math">\(x+\dx\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(\dx\)</span> is the error, which we hope is small). This measurement of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> may be used to compute some other value; we can think of this latter value as <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> for some function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> As the true length is <span class="process-math">\(x+\dx\text{,}\)</span> one really should have computed <span class="process-math">\(f(x+\dx)\text{.}\)</span> The difference between <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(x+\dx)\)</span> is the propagated error.</div>
