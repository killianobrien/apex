<div class="para">Imagine standing in a rolling meadow, then beginning to walk due east. Depending on your location, you might walk up, sharply down, or perhaps not change elevation at all. This is similar to measuring <span class="process-math">\(z_x\text{:}\)</span> you are moving only east (in the “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>”-direction) and not north/south at all. Going back to your original location, imagine now walking due north (in the “<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>”-direction). Perhaps walking due north does not change your elevation at all. This is analogous to <span class="process-math">\(z_y=0\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> does not change with respect to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> We can see that <span class="process-math">\(z_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z_y\)</span> do not have to be the same, or even similar, as it is easy to imagine circumstances where walking east means you walk downhill, though walking north makes you walk uphill.</div>
