<div class="para">It is natural to assume that a function is equal to its Taylor series on the series' interval of convergence, but this is not always the case. In order to properly establish equality, one must use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_function_series_equality.html" title="Theorem 9.8.6: Function and Taylor Series Equality">Theorem 9.8.6</a>. This is a bit disappointing, as we developed beautiful techniques for determining the interval of convergence of a power series, and proving that <span class="process-math">\(R_n(x)\to 0\)</span> can be difficult. For instance, it is not a simple task to show that <span class="process-math">\(\ln x\)</span> equals its Taylor series on <span class="process-math">\((0,2]\)</span> as found in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_ts2.html" title="Example 9.8.4: The Taylor series of f(x)=\ln(x) at x=1">Example 9.8.4</a>; in the Exercises, the reader is only asked to show equality on <span class="process-math">\((1,2)\text{,}\)</span> which is simpler.</div>
