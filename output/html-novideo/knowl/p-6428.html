Likewise, “<span class="process-math">\(0\cdot \infty\)</span>” does not mean “multiply zero by infinity.” Instead, it means “one quantity is shrinking to zero, and is being multiplied by a quantity that is growing without bound.” We cannot determine from such a description what the result of such a limit will be.</div>
