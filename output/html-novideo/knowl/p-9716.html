<div class="para">We have explored functions of the form <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> closely throughout this text. We have explored their limits, their derivatives and their antiderivatives; we have learned to identify key features of their graphs, such as relative maxima and minima, inflection points and asymptotes; we have found equations of their tangent lines, the areas between portions of their graphs and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, and the volumes of solids generated by revolving portions of their graphs about a horizontal or vertical axis.</div>
