<aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">The assumption about instantaneous mixing, though not physically accurate, leads to a differential equation we have hope of solving. In reality, the amount of chemical at a specific location in the container depends both on the location and how long we have been waiting. This dependence on both space and time leads to a type of differential equation called a <em class="emphasis">partial differential equation.</em> Differential equations of this type are more interesting, but significantly harder to study. Instantaneous mixing removes any spatial dependence from the problem, and leaves us with an <em class="emphasis">ordinary differential equation</em>.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_Modeling.html#aside-52" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
