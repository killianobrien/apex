<div class="para">In <a href="sec_line_int_intro.html" class="internal" title="Section 15.1: Introduction to Line Integrals">Section 15.1</a>, we recalled the arc length differential <span class="process-math">\(ds=\snorm{\vrp(t)}dt\text{.}\)</span> In subsequent sections, we used that differential, but in most applications the “<span class="process-math">\(\snorm{\vrp(t)}\)</span>” part of the differential canceled out of the integrand (to our benefit, as integrating the square roots of functions is generally difficult). We will find a similar thing happens when we use the surface area differential <span class="process-math">\(dS\)</span> in the following sections. That is, our main goal is not to be able to compute surface area; rather, surface area is a tool to obtain other quantities that are more important and useful. In our applications, we will use <span class="process-math">\(dS\text{,}\)</span> but most of the time the “<span class="process-math">\(\snorm{\vec r_u\times \vec r_v}\)</span>” part will cancel out of the integrand, making the subsequent integration easier to compute.</div>
