<div class="para">The underlying sequence is <span class="process-math">\(\{a_n\} = \abs{\sin(n) }/n\text{.}\)</span> This sequence is positive and approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(n\to\infty\text{.}\)</span> However, it is not a decreasing sequence; the value of <span class="process-math">\(\abs{\sin(n) }\)</span> oscillates between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(n\to\infty\text{.}\)</span> We cannot remove a finite number of terms to make <span class="process-math">\(\{a_n\}\)</span> decreasing, therefore we cannot apply the Alternating Series Test. Keep in mind that this does not mean we conclude the series diverges; in fact, it does converge. We are just unable to conclude this based on <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_alt_series_test.html" title="Theorem 9.5.2: Alternating Series Test">TheoremÂ 9.5.2</a>. We will be able to show that this series converges shortly.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_alt_series.html#li-1834" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
