<div class="para">The study of differential equations is a natural extension of the study of derivatives and integrals. The equations themselves involve derivatives, and methods to find analytic solutions often involve finding antiderivatives. In this section, we focus on graphical and numerical techniques to understand solutions to differential equations. We restrict our examples to relatively simple initial value problems that permit analytic solutions to the equations, but we should remember that this is only for comparison purposes. In reality, many differential equations, even some that appear straightforward, do not have solutions we can find analytically. Even so, we can use the techniques presented in this section to understand the behavior of solutions. In the next two sections, we explore two techniques to find analytic solutions to two different classes of differential equations.</div>
