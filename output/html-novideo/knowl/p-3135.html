<div class="para">One is often tempted to think that functions always alternate “increasing, decreasing, increasing, decreasing,…” around critical values. Our previous example demonstrated that this is not always the case. While <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> was not technically a critical value, it was an important value we needed to consider. We found that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> was decreasing on “both sides of <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span>”</div>
