<div class="para">Recall how in our previous work that the displacement of the object (in this case, its height) was found as the area under the velocity curve, as shaded in the figure. Moreover, the area between the curve and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis that is below the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis counted as “negative” area. That is, it represents the object coming back toward its starting position. So to find the maximum distance from the starting point — the maximum height — we find the area under the velocity line that is above the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis, i.e., from <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t=1.5\text{.}\)</span> This region is a triangle; its area is</div>

\amp = 36\text{ ft }
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">which matches our previous calculation of the maximum height.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Finally, to find the height of the object at time <span class="process-math">\(t=2\)</span> we calculate the total “signed area” (where some area is negative) under the velocity function from <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t=2\text{.}\)</span> This signed area is equal to <span class="process-math">\(s(2)\text{,}\)</span> the displacement (i.e., signed distance) from the starting position at <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> to the position at time <span class="process-math">\(t=2\text{.}\)</span> That is,</div> <div class="para">Displacement = Area above the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis <span class="process-math">\(-\)</span> Area below <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis.</div> <div class="para logical">

</div> <div class="para">This also matches our previous calculation of the height at <span class="process-math">\(t=2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Notice how we answered each question in this example in two ways. Our first method was to manipulate equations using our understanding of antiderivatives and derivatives. Our second method was geometric: we answered questions looking at a graph and finding the areas of certain regions of this graph.</div>
