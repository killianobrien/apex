<div class="para">Referring back to the falling amusement park ride, knowing that at <span class="process-math">\(t=2\)</span> the velocity was <span class="process-math">\(-64\)</span> ft/s, we could reasonably approximate that <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> second later the riders' height would have dropped by about <span class="process-math">\(64\)</span> feet. Knowing that the riders were <em class="emphasis">accelerating</em> as they fell would inform us that this is an <em class="emphasis">under-approximation</em>. If all we knew was that <span class="process-math">\(f(2) = 86\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\fp(2) = -64\text{,}\)</span> we'd know that we'd have to stop the riders quickly otherwise they would hit the ground.</div>
