<div class="para">Thinking in terms of units can help fill in the details of the differential equation. Since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> has units of grams, the left hand side of the equation has units g/min. Both terms on the right hand side must have these same units. Notice that the product of a concentration (with units g/L) and a flow rate (with units L/min) results in a quantity with units g/min. Both terms on the right hand side of the equation will include a concentration multiplied by a flow rate.</div>
