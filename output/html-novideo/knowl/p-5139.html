<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_simpsons2.html" title="Figure 5.5.17">FigureÂ 5.5.17</a> illustrates how the area calculated by Simpson's Rule approximates <span class="process-math">\(\int_0^5 f(x)\, dx\)</span> for the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sin(\pi x)\text{.}\)</span> In this case, <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> subintervals were used, resulting in <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> quadratic curves (dashed lines) being fitted to each pair of subintervals. The actual answer (accurate to <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> decimal places) is about <span class="process-math">\(10.6366\text{,}\)</span> while Simpson's rule gives <span class="process-math">\(10.7294\text{.}\)</span> Of course more subintervals would result in better accuracy. However <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> intervals were chosen specifically so that you could see how the parabolas compare to the original function. With larger values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> it becomes difficult to distinguish the function and its quadratic approximations on each subinterval.</div>
