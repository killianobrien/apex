<div class="para">We have applied these terms to regions of the plane, but they can be extended intuitively to domains in space (and hyperspace). In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_simply_connected_spacea_3D.html" title="Figure 15.3.13.(a)">Figure 15.3.13.(a)</a>, the domain bounded by the sphere (at left) and the domain with a subsphere removed (at right) are both simply connected. Any simple closed path that lies entirely within these domains can be continuously deformed into a single point. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_simply_connected_spacea_3D.html" title="Figure 15.3.13.(a)">Figure 15.3.13.(a)</a>, neither domain is simply connected. A left, the ball has a hole that extends its length and the pictured closed path cannot be deformed to a point. At right, two paths are illustrated on the torus that cannot be shrunk to a point.</div>
