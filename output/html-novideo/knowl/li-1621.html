<div class="para">First notice how the sign changes from term to term. This is most commonly accomplished by multiplying the terms by either <span class="process-math">\((-1)^n\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\((-1)^{n+1}\text{.}\)</span> Using <span class="process-math">\((-1)^n\)</span> multiplies the odd indexed terms by <span class="process-math">\((-1)\text{.}\)</span> Thus the first term would be negative and the second term would be positive. Multiplying by <span class="process-math">\((-1)^{n+1}\)</span> multiplies the even indexed terms by <span class="process-math">\((-1)\text{.}\)</span> Thus the second term would be negative and the first term would be positive. As this sequence has negative even indexed terms, we will multiply by <span class="process-math">\((-1)^{n+1}\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">After this, we might feel a bit stuck as to how to proceed. At this point, we are just looking for a pattern of some sort: what do the numbers 2, 5, 10, 17, etc., have in common? There are many correct answers, but the one that we'll use here is that each is one more than a perfect square. That is, <span class="process-math">\(2=1^2+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(5=2^2+1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(10=3^2+1\text{,}\)</span> etc. Thus our formula is <span class="process-math">\(b_n= (-1)^{n+1}(n^2+1)\text{.}\)</span>
