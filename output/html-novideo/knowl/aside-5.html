<aside class="aside aside-like"><div class="para">In this text, when we use the term “closed interval”, we mean an interval of the form <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are real numbers. One may be surprised to learn that intervals of the form <span class="process-math">\([a,\infty)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((-\infty, b]\)</span> and even <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,\infty)\)</span> are all also considered closed in advanced calculus. While the mathematics supported by this definition of closed is fascinating and important, it is beyond the scope of our purposes here.</div>
<div class="para">Some results, such as <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_extreme_val.html" title="Theorem 3.1.3: The Extreme Value Theorem">The Extreme Value Theorem</a>, are valid for intervals of the form <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> but not for intervals such as <span class="process-math">\([a,\infty)\text{.}\)</span> The latter interval is closed, but not <dfn class="terminology">bounded</dfn>. </div>
<div class="para">A set of real numbers is bounded if there is a number that is greater than every element in the set (an upper bound), and a number that is less than every element in the set (a lower bound). When we do calculus in higher dimensions, we can no longer talk about intervals, but we can still talk about sets being closed and bounded. See <a href="sec_multi_extreme_values.html" class="internal" title="Section 13.8: Extreme Values">Section 13.8</a> for details.</div></aside><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_continuity.html#aside-5" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
