<div class="para">This new understanding allows us to revisit what we did in the previous section. Given a region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> in the plane, we computed <span class="process-math">\(\iint_R 1\, dA\text{;}\)</span> again, our understanding at the time was that we were finding the area of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> However, we can now view the graph <span class="process-math">\(z=1\)</span> as a surface, a flat surface with constant <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-value of 1. The double integral <span class="process-math">\(\iint_R 1\, dA\)</span> finds the volume, under <span class="process-math">\(z=1\text{,}\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_double_summary.html" title="Figure 14.2.23">Figure 14.2.23</a>. Basic geometry tells us that if the base of a general right cylinder has area <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> its volume is <span class="process-math">\(A\cdot h\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is the height. In our case, the height is 1. We were “actually” computing the volume of a solid, though we interpreted the number as an area.</div>
