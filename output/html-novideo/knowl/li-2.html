<div class="para">The examples generally show “all” the steps needed to solve a problem. Sometimes reading through each step is helpful; sometimes it is confusing. When the steps are illustrating a new technique, one probably should follow each step closely to learn the new technique. When the steps are showing the mathematics needed to find a number to be used later, one can usually skip ahead and see how that number is being used, instead of getting bogged down in reading how the number was found.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="apex-preface.html#li-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
