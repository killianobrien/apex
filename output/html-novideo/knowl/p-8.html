<span class="heading"><span class="title">Please read the text.</span></span><div class="para">It is written to explain the concepts of Calculus. There are numerous examples to demonstrate the meaning of definitions, the truth of theorems, and the application of mathematical techniques. When you encounter a sentence you don't understand, read it again. If it still doesn't make sense, read on anyway, as sometimes confusing sentences are explained by later sentences.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">You don't have to read every equation.</span></span><div class="para">The examples generally show “all” the steps needed to solve a problem. Sometimes reading through each step is helpful; sometimes it is confusing. When the steps are illustrating a new technique, one probably should follow each step closely to learn the new technique. When the steps are showing the mathematics needed to find a number to be used later, one can usually skip ahead and see how that number is being used, instead of getting bogged down in reading how the number was found.</div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Most proofs have been omitted.</span></span><div class="para">In mathematics, <em class="emphasis">proving</em> something is always true is extremely important, and entails much more than testing to see if it works twice. However, students often are confused by the details of a proof, or become concerned that they should have been able to construct this proof on their own. To alleviate this potential problem, we do not include the proofs to most theorems in the text. The interested reader is highly encouraged to find proofs online or from their instructor. In most cases, one is very capable of understanding what a theorem <em class="emphasis">means</em> and <em class="emphasis">how to apply it</em> without knowing fully <em class="emphasis">why</em> it is true.</div>
