<div class="para">The dimensions of the tank in this problem are irrelevant. All we are concerned with are the dimensions of the hatch and the depth of the fluid. Since the dimensions of the hatch are the same as the base of the tank in the previous part of this example, as is the depth, we see that the fluid force is the same. That is, <span class="process-math">\(F = 6283\)</span> <span class="quantity">lb</span>. A key concept to understand here is that we are effectively measuring the weight of a <span class="quantity">10 ft</span> column of water above the hatch. The size of the tank holding the fluid does not matter.</div>
