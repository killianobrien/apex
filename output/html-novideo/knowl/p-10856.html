<span class="process-math">\(\ds y=\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{z^2}{16}\text{:}\)</span> We first identify the quadric by pattern-matching with the equations given previously. Only two surfaces have equations where one variable is raised to the first power, the elliptic paraboloid and the hyperbolic paraboloid. In the latter case, the other variables have different signs, so we conclude that this describes a hyperbolic paraboloid. As the variable with the first power is <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> we note the paraboloid opens along the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis. To make a decent sketch by hand, we need only draw a few traces. In this case, the traces <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z=0\)</span> form parabolas that outline the shape.</div>
