<div class="para">This problem is intentionally ambiguous; we are to <em class="emphasis">approximate</em> using an <em class="emphasis">appropriate</em> tangent line. How good of an approximation are we seeking? What does “appropriate” mean?</div> <div class="para">In the “real world,” people solving problems deal with these issues all time. One must make a judgment using whatever seems reasonable. In this example, the actual answer is <span class="process-math">\(f(3) = \sin(3) + 7\text{,}\)</span> where the real problem spot is <span class="process-math">\(\sin(3)\text{.}\)</span> What is <span class="process-math">\(\sin(3)\text{?}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> is close to <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{,}\)</span> we can assume <span class="process-math">\(\sin(3) \approx \sin(\pi) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Thus one guess is <span class="process-math">\(f(3) \approx 7\text{.}\)</span> Can we do better? Let's use a tangent line as instructed and examine the results; it seems best to find the tangent line at <span class="process-math">\(x=\pi\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_deriv_common.html" title="Theorem 2.3.1: Derivatives of Common Functions">Theorem 2.3.1</a> we find <span class="process-math">\(\fp(x) = \cos(x) + 2\text{.}\)</span> The slope of the tangent line is thus <span class="process-math">\(\fp(\pi) = \cos(\pi) + 2 =1\text{.}\)</span> Also, <span class="process-math">\(f(\pi) = 2\pi+1 \approx 7.28\text{.}\)</span> So the tangent line to the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=\pi\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(y=1(x-\pi)+ 2\pi+1 =x+\pi+1 \approx x+4.14\text{.}\)</span> Evaluated at <span class="process-math">\(x=3\text{,}\)</span> our tangent line gives <span class="process-math">\(y=3+4.14 = 7.14\text{.}\)</span> Using the tangent line, our final approximation is that <span class="process-math">\(f(3) \approx 7.14\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Using a calculator, we get an answer accurate to four places after the decimal: <span class="process-math">\(f(3) = 7.1411\text{.}\)</span> Our initial guess was <span class="process-math">\(7\text{;}\)</span> our tangent line approximation was more accurate, at <span class="process-math">\(7.14\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The point is <em class="emphasis">not</em> “Here's a cool way to do some math without a calculator.” Sure, that might be handy sometime, but your phone could probably give you the answer. Rather, the point is to say that tangent lines are a good way of approximating, and many scientists, engineers and mathematicians often face problems too hard to solve directly. So they approximate.</div> <div class="para">The graphs in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_sintangapprox.html" title="Figure 2.3.6">Figure 2.3.6</a> shows the graph of the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> along with the tangent line constructed at <span class="process-math">\(x=\pi\text{.}\)</span> The graph in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_sintangapprox.html" title="Figure 2.3.6">Figure 2.3.6</a> shows the same tangent line and function. Once zoomed in, you can barely distinguish the tangent line from the function. This indicates that the tangent line is a good a approximation of the function so long as we are near the point of tangency.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
