<div class="para">We have found that when <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin(x)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\fp(x) = \cos(x)\text{.}\)</span> This should be somewhat amazing; the result of a tedious limit process on the sine function is a nice function. Then again, perhaps this is not entirely surprising. The sine function is periodic â€” it repeats itself on regular intervals. Therefore its rate of change also repeats itself on the same regular intervals. We should have known the derivative would be periodic; we now know exactly which periodic function it is.</div>
