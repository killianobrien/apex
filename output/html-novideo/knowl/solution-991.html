<div class="para">It is obviously very difficult to simply look at these equations and discern anything. This is done intentionally. In the “real world,” most equations that are used do not have nice, integer coefficients. Rather, there are lots of digits after the decimal and the equations can look “messy.”</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We again start by deciding whether or not each line has the same direction. The direction of <span class="process-math">\(\ell_1\)</span> is given by <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_1 = \la 1.6,2.72,-3.36\ra\)</span> and the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\ell_2\)</span> is given by <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_2 = \la -2.9,-4.93,6.09\ra\text{.}\)</span> When it is not clear through observation whether two vectors are parallel or not, the standard way of determining this is by comparing their respective unit vectors. Using a calculator, we find:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\vec u_1 \amp = \frac{\vec d_1}{\norm{\vec d_1}} = \la 0.3471,0.5901,-0.7289\ra\\
\vec u_2 \amp = \frac{\vec d_2}{\norm{\vec d_2}} = \la -0.3471,-0.5901,0.7289\ra\text{.}

<div class="para">The two vectors seem to be parallel (at least, their components are equal to 4 decimal places). In most situations, it would suffice to conclude that the lines are at least parallel, if not the same. One way to be sure is to rewrite <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vec d_2\)</span> in terms of fractions, not decimals. We have</div>

<div class="para">One can then find the magnitudes of each vector in terms of fractions, then compute the unit vectors likewise. After a lot of manual arithmetic (or after briefly using a computer algebra system), one finds that</div>
