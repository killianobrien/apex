<div class="para">The important quantities that are changing are: the distance of the officer to the intersection, the distance of the car to the intersection, and the distance of the officer to the car.

As both the police officer and other driver are <span class="process-math">\(1/2\)</span> mile from the intersection, we have <span class="process-math">\(A = 1/2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B = 1/2\text{,}\)</span> and through the Pythagorean Theorem, <span class="process-math">\(C = 1/\sqrt{2}\approx 0.707\text{.}\)</span> These values are “instantaneous” values for our variables, so we won't use them until the <em class="emphasis">end</em> of the problem. Instead, we will use the variables <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>
