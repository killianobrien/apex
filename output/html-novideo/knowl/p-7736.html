<div class="para">While the slope field is an effective way to understand the qualitative behavior of solutions to a differential equation, it is difficult to use a slope field to make quantitative predictions. For example, if we have the slope field for the differential equation <span class="process-math">\(\yp = x+y\)</span> from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_slope_field.html" title="Example 8.1.10: Sketching a slope field">ExampleÂ 8.1.10</a> along with the initial condition <span class="process-math">\(y(0)=1\text{,}\)</span> we can understand the qualitative behavior of the solution to the initial value problem, but will struggle to predict a specific value, <span class="process-math">\(y(2)\)</span> for example, with any degree of confidence. The most straightforward way to predict <span class="process-math">\(y(2)\)</span> is to find the analytic solution to the the initial value problem and evaluate it at <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{.}\)</span> Unfortunately, we have already mentioned that it is impossible to find analytic solutions to many differential equations. In the absence of an analytic solution, a <em class="emphasis">numerical solution</em> can serve as an effective tool to make quantitative predictions about the solution to an initial value problem.</div>
