<div class="para">Note the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 5x+2\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_rie8.html" title="Figure 5.3.17">Figure 5.3.17</a>. The regions whose area is computed by the definite integral are triangles, meaning we can find the exact answer without summation techniques. We find that the exact answer is indeed 22.5. One of the strengths of the Midpoint Rule is that often each rectangle includes area that should not be counted, but misses other area that should. When the partition size is small, these two amounts are about equal and these errors almost “cancel each other out.” In this example, since our function is a line, these errors are exactly equal and they do cancel each other out, giving us the exact answer.</div>
