<div class="para">Continuity is inherently tied to the properties of limits. Because of this, the properties of limits found in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_limit_algebra.html" title="Theorem 1.3.1: Basic Limit Properties">Theorems 1.3.1</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_poly_rat.html" title="Theorem 1.3.3: Limits of Polynomial and Rational Functions">Theorem 1.3.3</a> apply to continuity as well. Further, now knowing the definition of continuity we can re-read <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_lim_continuous.html" title="Theorem 1.3.5: Limits of Common Functions">Theorem 1.3.5</a> as giving a list of functions that are continuous on their domains. The following theorem states how continuous functions can be combined to form other continuous functions, followed by a theorem which formally lists functions that we know are continuous on their domains.</div>
