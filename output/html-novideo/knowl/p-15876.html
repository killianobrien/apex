<div class="para">There is an important connection between the circulation around a closed region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and the curl of the vector field inside of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> as well as a connection between the flux across the boundary of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and the divergence of the field inside <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> These connections are described by Green's Theorem and the Divergence Theorem, respectively. We'll explore each in turn. </div>
