<div class="para">To find the minimal speed, we could apply calculus techniques (such as set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> etc.) but we can find it by inspection. Inside the square root we have a quadratic which is minimized when <span class="process-math">\(t=0\text{.}\)</span> Thus the speed is minimized at <span class="process-math">\(t=0\text{,}\)</span> with a speed of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> <span class="quantity"><sup>ft</sup>⁄<sub>s</sub></span>. The graph in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_motion1b.html" title="Figure 12.3.3.(b)">Figure 12.3.3.(b)</a> also implies speed is minimized here. The filled dots on the graph are located at integer values of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(-3\)</span> and 3. Dots that are far apart imply the object traveled a far distance in 1 second, indicating high speed; dots that are close together imply the object did not travel far in 1 second, indicating a low speed. The dots are closest together near <span class="process-math">\(t=0\text{,}\)</span> implying the speed is minimized near that value.</div>
