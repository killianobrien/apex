<div class="para">Many quantities we think about daily can be described by a single number: temperature, speed, cost, weight and height. There are also many other concepts we encounter daily that cannot be described with just one number. For instance, a weather forecaster often describes wind with its speed and its direction (“<span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span> with winds from the southeast gusting up to 30 mph <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\)</span>”). When applying a force, we are concerned with both the magnitude and direction of that force. In both of these examples, <em class="emphasis">direction</em> is important. Because of this, we study <em class="emphasis">vectors</em>, mathematical objects that convey both magnitude and direction information.</div>
