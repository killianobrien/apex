For one, it fails the vertical line test, and so the complete curve is not truly representing <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> But when we indicate we are interested in the derivative at <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{,}\)</span> we are indicating that we want the function defined by the small portion of the curve that passes through <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{,}\)</span> and that small portion does pass the vertical line test. Such functions are important in many areas of mathematics, so developing tools to deal with them is also important.</div>
