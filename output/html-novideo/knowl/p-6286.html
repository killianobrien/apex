<div class="para">Because the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions, their inverses can be expressed in terms of logarithms as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/idea_hyperbolic_log.html" title="Key Idea 6.6.13: Logarithmic definitions of Inverse Hyperbolic Functions">Key IdeaÂ 6.6.13</a>. It is often more convenient to refer to <span class="process-math">\(\sinh^{-1}(x)\)</span> than to <span class="process-math">\(\ln\big(x+\sqrt{x^2+1}\big)\text{,}\)</span> especially when one is working on theory and does not need to compute actual values. On the other hand, when computations are needed, technology is often helpful but many hand-held calculators lack a <em class="emphasis">convenient</em> <span class="process-math">\(\sinh^{-1}(x)\)</span> button. (Often it can be accessed under a menu system, but not conveniently.) In such a situation, the logarithmic representation is useful. The reader is not encouraged to memorize these, but rather know they exist and know how to use them when needed.</div>
