<div class="para">We start with the approximation of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(1.5)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(p_6(1.5)\text{.}\)</span> The theorem references an open interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> that contains both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> The smaller the interval we use the better; it will give us a more accurate (and smaller!) approximation of the error. We let <span class="process-math">\(I = (0.9,1.6)\text{,}\)</span> as this interval contains both <span class="process-math">\(c=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1.5\text{.}\)</span> The theorem references <span class="process-math">\(\max\abs{f^{(n+1)}(z)}\text{.}\)</span> In our situation, this is asking “How big can the <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span>th derivative of <span class="process-math">\(y=\ln(x)\)</span> be on the interval <span class="process-math">\((0.9,1.6)\text{?}\)</span>” The seventh derivative is <span class="process-math">\(y = -6!/x^7\text{.}\)</span> The largest absolute value it attains on <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is about 1506. (There are no critical numbers of <span class="process-math">\(f^{(7)}\)</span> in the interval so we evaluate the endpoints: <span class="process-math">\(f^{(7)}(0.9)\approx 1506\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f^{(7)}(1.6)\approx 27\text{.}\)</span>) In particular, we are evaluating at <span class="process-math">\(x=1.5\text{,}\)</span> so we let <span class="process-math">\(x=1.5\text{.}\)</span> Thus we can bound the error as:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/thm_taylorthm.html">
\begin{align*}
\abs{R_6(1.5)} \amp \leq \frac{\max\abs{f^{(7)}(z)}}{7!}\abs{(1.5-1)^7}\\
\amp \leq \frac{1506}{5040}\cdot\frac1{2^7}\\
\amp \approx 0.0023\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">We computed <span class="process-math">\(p_6(1.5) = 0.404688\text{;}\)</span> using a calculator, we find <span class="process-math">\(\ln(1.5) \approx 0.405465\text{,}\)</span> so the actual error is about <span class="process-math">\(0.000778\text{,}\)</span> which is less than our bound of <span class="process-math">\(0.0023\text{.}\)</span> This affirms Taylor's Theorem; the theorem states that our approximation would be within about 2 thousandths of the actual value, whereas the approximation was actually closer. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_taylorthm.html" title="Theorem 9.7.13: Taylor's Theorem">Taylor's Theorem</a> only gives an upper bound on the error.</div>

<div class="para">We again find an interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> that contains both <span class="process-math">\(c=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=2\text{;}\)</span> we choose <span class="process-math">\(I = (0.9,2.1)\text{.}\)</span> The maximum value of the seventh derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on this interval is again about 1506 (as the largest values come near <span class="process-math">\(x=0.9\)</span>). Thus</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\abs{ R_6(2)} \amp \leq \frac{\max\abs{f^{(7)}(z)}}{7!}\abs{(2-1)^7}\\
\amp \leq \frac{1506}{5040}\cdot1^7\\
\amp \approx 0.30\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">This bound is not as nearly as good as before. Using the degree 6 Taylor polynomial at <span class="process-math">\(x =1\)</span> will bring us within 0.3 of the correct answer. As <span class="process-math">\(p_6(2)\approx 0.61667\text{,}\)</span> our error estimate guarantees that the actual value of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\)</span> is somewhere between <span class="process-math">\(0.31667\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0.91667\text{.}\)</span> These bounds are not particularly useful. In reality, our approximation was only off by about 0.07. However, we are approximating ostensibly because we do not know the real answer. In order to be assured that we have a good approximation, we would have to resort to using a polynomial of higher degree.</div>
