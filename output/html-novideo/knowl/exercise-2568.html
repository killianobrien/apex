<div class="para">It is “common sense” that it is far better to measure a long distance with a long measuring tape rather than a short one. A measured distance <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> can be viewed as the product of the length <span class="process-math">\(\ell\)</span> of a measuring tape times the number <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> of times it was used. For instance, using a 3' tape 10 times gives a length of 30'. To measure the same distance with a 12' tape, we would use the tape 2.5 times. (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(30=12\times 2.5\text{.}\)</span>) Thus <span class="process-math">\(D = n\ell\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Suppose each time a measurement is taken with the tape, the recorded distance is within 1/16'' of the actual distance. (i.e., <span class="process-math">\(d\ell = 1/16'' \approx 0.005\)</span>ft). Using differentials, show why common sense proves correct in that it is better to use a long tape to measure long distances.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_total_differential.html#exercise-2568" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
