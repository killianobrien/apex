However, some initial guesses should be avoided. For instance, consider <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_newt2.html" title="Example 4.1.3: Using Newton's Method">Example 4.1.3</a> where we sought the root to <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^3-x^2-1\text{.}\)</span> Choosing <span class="process-math">\(x_0=0\)</span> would have been a particularly poor choice. Consider <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_newt2a.html" title="Figure 4.1.7">Figure 4.1.7</a>, where <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is graphed along with its tangent line at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\fp(0)=0\text{,}\)</span> the tangent line is horizontal and does not intersect the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.

Once the approximations get close to the root, Newton's Method can as much as double the number of correct decimal places with each successive approximation. A course in Numerical Analysis will introduce the reader to more iterative root finding methods, as well as give greater detail about the strengths and weaknesses of Newton's Method.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_newton.html#paragraphs-9" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
