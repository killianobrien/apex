<div class="para">In the examples we have explored so far, we have found exact forms for the functions that solve the differential equations. Solutions of this type are called <em class="emphasis">analytic solutions.</em> Many times a differential equation has a solution, but it is difficult or impossible to find the solution analytically. This is analogous to algebraic equations. The algebraic equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0\)</span> has two real solutions that can be found analytically by using the quadratic formula. The equation <span class="process-math">\(\cos(x) = x\)</span> has one real solution, but we can't find it analytically. As shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_20_01_intersection.html" title="Figure 8.1.8">FigureÂ 8.1.8</a>, we can find an approximate solution graphically by plotting <span class="process-math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and observing the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-value of the intersection. We can similarly use graphical tools to understand the qualitative behavior of solutions to a first order-differential equation.</div>
