<div class="para">If the vector field represents the velocity of a fluid or gas, then the <em class="emphasis">divergence</em>  of the field is a measure of the “compressibility” of the fluid. If the divergence is negative at a point, it means that the fluid is compressing: more fluid is going into the point than is going out. If the divergence is positive, it means the fluid is expanding: more fluid is going out at that point than going in. A divergence of zero means the same amount of fluid is going in as is going out. If the divergence is zero at all points, we say the field is <em class="emphasis">incompressible</em>. </div>
