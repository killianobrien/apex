<div class="para">The limit <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\cos(x)\)</span> does not exist, as <span class="process-math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> oscillates (and takes on every value in <span class="process-math">\([-1,1]\)</span> infinitely many times). Thus we cannot apply <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_seq_limit.html" title="Theorem 9.1.10: Limit of a Sequence">Theorem 9.1.10</a>. The fact that the cosine function oscillates strongly hints that <span class="process-math">\(\cos(n)\text{,}\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is restricted to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{N}\text{,}\)</span> will also oscillate. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_seq4b.html" title="Figure 9.1.13">Figure 9.1.13</a>, where the sequence is plotted, shows that this is true. Because only discrete values of cosine are plotted, it does not bear strong resemblance to the familiar cosine wave. The proof of the following statement is beyond the scope of this text, but it is true: there are infinitely many integers <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> that are arbitrarily (i.e., <em class="emphasis">very</em>) close to an even multiple of <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\cos n \approx 1\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, there are infinitely many integers <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> that are arbitrarily close to an odd multiple of <span class="process-math">\(\pi\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\cos m \approx -1\text{.}\)</span> As the sequence takes on values near 1 and <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> infinitely many times, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}a_n\)</span> does not exist.</div>
