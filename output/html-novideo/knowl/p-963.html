<div class="para">However, this intuitive notion of continuity does help us understand another important concept as follows. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is defined on <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(1) = -10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(2) = 5\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous on <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\)</span> (i.e., its graph can be sketched as a continuous curve from <span class="process-math">\((1,-10)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((2,5)\)</span>) then we know intuitively that somewhere on the interval <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must be equal to <span class="process-math">\(-9\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-8\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-7,-6,\ldots,0,1/2\text{,}\)</span> etc. In short, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> takes on all <em class="emphasis">intermediate</em> values between <span class="process-math">\(-10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> It may take on more values; <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> may actually equal <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> at some time, for instance, but we are guaranteed all values between <span class="process-math">\(-10\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span>
