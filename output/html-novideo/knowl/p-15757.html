It turns out that regardless of the choice of path from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> the amount of work performed under the field <span class="process-math">\(\vec F = \la y, x\ra\)</span> is the same. Since our expectation is that differing amounts of work are performed along different paths, we give such special fields a name.</div>
