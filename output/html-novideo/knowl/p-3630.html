<div class="para">Solving equations is one of the most important things we do in mathematics, yet we are surprisingly limited in what we can solve analytically. For instance, equations as simple as <span class="process-math">\(x^5+x+1=0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\cos(x) =x\)</span> cannot be solved by algebraic methods in terms of familiar functions. Fortunately, there are methods that can give us <em class="emphasis">approximate</em> solutions to equations like these. These methods can usually give an approximation correct to as many decimal places as we like. In <a href="sec_continuity.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.5: Continuity">SectionÂ 1.5</a> we learned about the Bisection Method. This section focuses on another technique (which generally works faster), called Newton's Method.</div>
