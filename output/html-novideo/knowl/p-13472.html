<div class="para">We extend this idea to functions of two variables. Let <span class="process-math">\(z=f(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(\dx = dx\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\dy=dy\)</span> represent changes in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> respectively. Let <span class="process-math">\(\ddz = f(x+dx,y+dy) - f(x,y)\)</span> be the change in <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> over the change in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Recalling that <span class="process-math">\(f_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_y\)</span> give the instantaneous rates of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-change in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>- and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-directions, respectively, we can approximate <span class="process-math">\(\ddz\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(dz = f_xdx+f_ydy\text{;}\)</span> in words, the total change in <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is approximately the change caused by changing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> plus the change caused by changing <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> In a moment we give an indication of whether or not this approximation is any good. First we give a name to <span class="process-math">\(dz\text{.}\)</span>
