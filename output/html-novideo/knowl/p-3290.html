<div class="para">To find the possible points of inflection, we seek to find where <span class="process-math">\(\fpp(x)=0\)</span> and where <span class="process-math">\(\fpp\)</span> is not defined. Solving <span class="process-math">\(\fpp(x)=0\)</span> reduces to solving <span class="process-math">\(2x(x^2+3)=0\text{;}\)</span> we find <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> We find that <span class="process-math">\(\fpp \)</span>is not defined when <span class="process-math">\(x=\pm 1\text{,}\)</span> for then the denominator of <span class="process-math">\(\fpp \)</span>is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> We also note that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> itself is not defined at <span class="process-math">\(x=\pm1\text{,}\)</span> having a domain of <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,-1)\cup(-1,1)\cup(1,\infty)\text{.}\)</span> Since the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is the union of three intervals, it makes sense that the concavity of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> could switch across intervals. We technically cannot say that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a point of inflection at <span class="process-math">\(x=\pm1\)</span> as they are not part of the domain, but we must still consider these <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values to be important and will include them in our number line.</div>
