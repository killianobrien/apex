<div class="para">A graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> around <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and a table are given in Figures <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_nolimit1.html" title="Figure 1.1.13">Figure 1.1.13</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table_nolimit1.html" title="Table 1.1.14: Values of f(x) near x=1 in Example 1.1.12">Table 1.1.14</a>, respectively. It is clear that as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> does not seem to approach a single number. Instead, it seems as though <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> approaches two different numbers. When considering values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> less than <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (approaching <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> from the left), it seems that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is approaching <span class="process-math">\(2\text{;}\)</span> when considering values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> greater than <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (approaching <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> from the right), it seems that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is approaching <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Recognizing this behavior is important; we'll study this in greater depth later. Right now, it suffices to say that the limit does not exist since <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is approaching two <em class="emphasis">different</em> values as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span>
