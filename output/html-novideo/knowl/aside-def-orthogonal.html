<div class="para">Some texts define two vectors as being parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other.

While counter-intuitive, it is mathematically sound to allow <span class="process-math">\(\vec 0\)</span> to be both parallel and perpendicular to all vectors.</div>
<div class="para">We prefer the given definition of parallel as it is grounded in the fact that unit vectors provide direction information.
