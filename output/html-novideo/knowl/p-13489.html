<div class="para">Our intuitive understanding of differentiability of functions <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> of one variable was that the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> was “smooth.” A similar intuitive understanding of functions <span class="process-math">\(z=f(x,y)\)</span> of two variables is that the surface defined by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is also “smooth,” not containing cusps, edges, breaks, etc. The following theorem states that differentiable functions are continuous, followed by another theorem that provides a more tangible way of determining whether a great number of functions are differentiable or not.</div>
