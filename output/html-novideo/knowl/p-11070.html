<div class="para">It might seem odd that the sum of the forces applied to the chains is more than 50lb. We leave it to a physics class to discuss the full details, but offer this short explanation. Our equations were established so that the <em class="emphasis">vertical</em> components of each force sums to 50lb, thus supporting the weight. Since the chains are at an angle, they also pull against each other, creating an “additional” horizontal force while holding the weight in place.</div>
