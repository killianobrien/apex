The expression <span class="process-math">\(\infty-\infty\)</span> does not really mean “subtract infinity from infinity.” Rather, it means “One quantity is subtracted from the other, but both are growing without bound.” What is the result? It is possible to get every value between <span class="process-math">\(-\infty\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\infty\text{.}\)</span>
