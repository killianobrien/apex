<div class="para">It was long assumed that planets had circular orbits. This is known to be incorrect; the orbits are elliptical. Earth has an eccentricity of <span class="process-math">\(0.0167\)</span> â€” it has a nearly circular orbit. Mercury's orbit is the most eccentric, with <span class="process-math">\(e=0.2056\text{.}\)</span> (Pluto's eccentricity is greater, at <span class="process-math">\(e=0.248\text{,}\)</span> the greatest of all the currently known dwarf planets.) The planet with the most circular orbit is Venus, with <span class="process-math">\(e=0.0068\text{.}\)</span> The Earth's moon has an eccentricity of <span class="process-math">\(e=0.0549\text{,}\)</span> also very circular.</div>
