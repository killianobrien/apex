<div class="para">Recall the classic physics equation, “Force <span class="process-math">\(=\)</span> mass <span class="times-sign">×</span> acceleration.” A force acting on a mass induces acceleration (i.e., the mass moves); acceleration acting on a mass induces a force (gravity gives our mass a <em class="emphasis">weight</em>). Thus force and acceleration are closely related. A moving ball “wants” to travel in a straight line. Why does the ball in our example move in a circle? It is attached to the boy's hand by a string. The string applies a force to the ball, affecting its motion: the string <em class="emphasis">accelerates</em> the ball. This is not acceleration in the sense of “it travels faster;” rather, this acceleration is changing the velocity of the ball. In what direction is this force/acceleration being applied? In the direction of the string, towards the boy's hand.</div>
