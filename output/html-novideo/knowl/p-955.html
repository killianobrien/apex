<div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{x\to a}f(x)=L\)</span> exists, but <span class="process-math">\(L\neq f(a)\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> is undefined. Such a discontinuity is called a <dfn class="terminology">removable discontinuity</dfn> .</div>
<div class="para">A removable discontinuity can be pictured as a “hole” in the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> The term “removable” refers to the fact that by simply redefining <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> to equal <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> (that is, changing the value of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at a single point), we can create a new function that is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\text{,}\)</span> and agrees with <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at all <span class="process-math">\(x\neq a\text{.}\)</span>

<span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{x\to a^+}f(x) = L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lim\limits_{x\to a^-}f(x)=M\)</span> exist, but <span class="process-math">\(L\neq M\text{.}\)</span> In this case the left and right hand limits both exist, but since they are not equal, the limit of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\to a\)</span> does not exist. Such a discontinuity is called a <dfn class="terminology">jump discontinuity</dfn>. </div>
<div class="para">The phrase “jump discontinuity” is meant to represent the fact that visually, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> “jumps” from one value to another as we cross the value <span class="process-math">\(x=a\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">The function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">unbounded</em> near <span class="process-math">\(x=a\text{.}\)</span> This means that the value of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> becomes arbitrarily large (or large and negative) as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Such a discontinuity is called an <dfn class="terminology">infinite discontinuity</dfn>. </div>
<div class="para">Infinite discontinuities are most easily understood in terms of <em class="emphasis">infinite limits</em>, which are discussed in <a href="sec_limits_infty.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.6: Limits Involving Infinity">Section 1.6</a>.</div>
