<div class="para">It is good practice to try to visualize certain vector fields in one's head. For instance, consider a point mass at the origin and the vector field that represents the gravitational force exerted by the mass at any point in the room. The field would consist of arrows pointing toward the origin, increasing in size as they near the origin (as the gravitational pull is strongest near the point mass).</div>
