<div class="para">We introduced the concept of a limit gently, approximating their values graphically and numerically. Next came the rigorous definition of the limit, along with an admittedly tedious method for evaluating them. <a href="sec_limit_analytically.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.3: Finding Limits Analytically">Section 1.3</a> gave us tools (which we call theorems) that allow us to compute limits with greater ease. Chief among the results were the facts that polynomials and rational, trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic functions (and their sums, products, etc.) all behave “nicely.” In this section we rigorously define what we mean by “nicely.”</div>
