<div class="para">We also saw in the example that the flux across <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> was 0 when the field was <span class="process-math">\(\vec F_2 = \la -x, 2y-x\ra\text{.}\)</span> Flux measures “how much” of the field crosses the path from left to right (following the conventions established before). Positive flux means most of the field is crossing from left to right; negative flux means most of the field is crossing from right to left; zero flux means the same amount crosses from each side. When we consider <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_flux1b.html" title="Figure 15.4.5.(b)">Figure 15.4.5.(b)</a>, it seems plausible that the same amount of <span class="process-math">\(\vec F_2\)</span> was crossing <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> from left to right as from right to left.</div>
