<div class="para">Pick a point <span class="process-math">\((u,v)\)</span> in the interior of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and consider <span class="process-math">\(\vec n(u,v)\text{.}\)</span> For instance, choose <span class="process-math">\((1/2,1/2)\)</span> and look at <span class="process-math">\(\vec n(1/2,1/2) = \langle 2,1,1\rangle/\sqrt{6}\text{.}\)</span> This vector has positive <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> components. Generally speaking, one has <em class="emphasis">some</em> idea of what the surface <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> looks like, as that surface is for some reason important. In our case, we know <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\)</span> is a plane with <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-intercept of <span class="process-math">\(z=3\text{.}\)</span> Knowing <span class="process-math">\(\vec n\)</span> and the flux measurement of positive <span class="process-math">\(5/3\text{,}\)</span> we know that the field must be passing from “behind” <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\text{,}\)</span> i.e., the side the origin is on, to the “front” of <span class="process-math">\(\surfaceS\text{.}\)</span>
