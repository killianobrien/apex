<div class="para">Computing the circulation directly using the line integral looks difficult, as the integrand will include terms like “<span class="process-math">\(\sin\big(2\cos t + \frac1{10}\cos(10t)\big)\text{.}\)</span>”</div> <div class="para">Green's Theorem states that <span class="process-math">\(\oint_C\vec F\cdot d\vec r = \iint_R \curl\vec F\, dA\text{;}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(\curl \vec F = 0\)</span> in this example, the double integral is simply 0 and hence the circulation is 0.</div> <div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(\curl \vec F = 0\text{,}\)</span> we can conclude that the circulation is 0 in two ways. One method is to employ Green's Theorem as done above. The second way is to recognize that <span class="process-math">\(\vec F\)</span> is a conservative field, hence there is a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y)\)</span> wherein <span class="process-math">\(\vec F = \nabla f\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be any point on the curve <span class="process-math">\(C\text{;}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is closed, we can say that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> “begins” and “ends” at <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> By the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, <span class="process-math">\(\oint_C \vec F\, d\vec r = f(A)-f(A) = 0\text{.}\)</span>
